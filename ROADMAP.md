# PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence Roadmap

## Vision

PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence is evolving into a complete operational intelligence platform for PeopleSoft.

The long-term objective is to provide a unified interface for:

- Metadata exploration
- Dependency analysis
- Runtime observability
- Environment comparison
- Security analysis
- Operational tooling
- AI-assisted engineering workflows

# Phase 4 — Runtime Intelligence

## Live Session Explorer

Provide complete end-to-end session visibility.

### ✅ Completed

- Oracle session tracking (V$SESSION, V$SQL)
- SQL execution visibility and top-SQL analysis
- Wait events and Oracle ASH integration
- Lock analysis and blocking chains
- Process Scheduler linkage and instance deep-linking
- Integration Broker activity and queue depth
- Runtime graph API connecting sessions, processes, operators, AEs, Oracle SQL, and IB services
- Runtime alerts for process errors, long processes, queue depth, blocking sessions, high wait, and domain health

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — Operational Dashboard

- `/admin/` home page replaced with a live operational dashboard; auto-refreshes every 60s
- **Active Alerts panel** — calls `GET /api/runtime/alerts`; shows all active alerts with severity badges and deep-links; green "All Clear" when 0 alerts
- **Runtime Health panel** — calls `GET /api/runtime/status`; shows process total/active/error, AE running, IB pending with color-coded values
- **Log Intelligence panel** — aggregates source count, source errors, PRCS AE error count, IGW error total; shows last ingest timestamp
- **Environment & Trends panel** — drift alert count vs FSCM; 6h runtime metric sparklines (Active, Errors, IB, Alerts) from runtimedb history
- **Quick Navigation** — 16 deep-links to every major platform section in one bar
- Log-based alert checks added to `connectors/alerts.py`: `_check_igw_errors()` (IGW spike >20/h), `_check_log_error_spike()` (non-IGW errors >30/h), `_check_prcs_ae_failures()` (PRCS AE failures in last 24h), `_check_error_trend()` (runtimedb trend detection: process_error going from 0→N)

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — Runtime History Persistence

- `connectors/runtimedb.py` — SQLite store at `data/runtime.db`; one row per 5-minute scheduler cycle per env; columns: process_active, process_error, process_total, ae_running, ib_pending, alert_count; `record()`, `get_history()`, `prune()` (30-day retention)
- `connectors/scheduler.py` — `_runtime_snapshot_loop()` thread (5-minute interval); calls process_status_summary + ib_queue_summary + evaluate_alerts; records to runtimedb; integrated into `start()`/`stop()`/`status()`
- `routers/runtime.py` — `GET /api/runtime/history?env&hours` time-series endpoint; `GET /api/runtime/history/snapshot` manual trigger
- `routers/admin/runtime.py` — "Metrics History" card on Runtime Monitor: 1h/6h/24h/7d period selector; sparkline SVG charts for Active Processes, Process Errors, AE Running, IB Pending, Alerts; trend arrows (↑↓→) colored by whether the metric increasing is good or bad; `loadHistory()` called on every refresh cycle

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-03) — App Server Process Tracking

Domain-level enumeration (`psdb.app_server_domains`) only sees Oracle's
`PSPMDOMAIN_VW` view — no live process detail. This goes one level deeper:

- `connectors/sshclient.py` — new `run_command(alias, command, timeout)`
  generic SSH command runner (read-only; joins the existing `list_files`/
  `read_bytes` helpers)
- `connectors/appsrvproc.py` — SSH `ps -eo pid,ppid,pcpu,pmem,etime,cmd` on
  the app server host; parses Tuxedo command lines for known PeopleSoft
  server binaries (PSAPPSRV, PSAESRV, PSSAMSRV, PSBRKHND, PSMSTPRC, PSDSTSRV,
  PSMONITORSRV, BBL, WSL/WSH, JSL/JSH); extracts domain name (`-C dom=`),
  group/server ID, and database name (`-D`/`-CD`/`-PS`) from each process's
  Tuxedo-encoded arguments. Note: `-S NAME` is a legitimate, more-specific
  server-group name for PeopleSoft app-level servers (e.g. `PSBRKHND_dflt`)
  but means something else entirely (shared-memory key, buffer size) for
  Tuxedo infrastructure processes (BBL/WSL/WSH/JSL/JSH) — the parser only
  applies that override for the former.
- `routers/runtime.py` — `GET /api/runtime/appserver-processes?env=` resolves
  the SSH host from `log_sources` (type `appsrv`/`prcs_ae`) for the env, lists
  live processes, and rolls up per-domain/per-server-type summaries
- `routers/admin/runtime.py` — new "App Server Processes" card on the Runtime
  Monitor page, refreshed on every cycle alongside domains/servers

**Remaining — blocked on live traffic data (2026-07-03 investigation):**
- **Browser session tracking**: would reconstruct sessions from `web_entries`
  (PIA access log: ip/oprid/url/ts — plenty of columns to group into sessions
  by idle-gap) but `PIA_access.log` is 0 bytes on this box — no HTTP access
  logging is active in this lab's WebLogic domain, so there is nothing to
  ingest or verify against. Triggered a full `/api/logs/ingest` and confirmed
  `web_entries` stays empty.
- **WebLogic session tracking**: `PIA_weblogic.log` does have 2.2MB of real
  content, but it's exclusively startup/health/diagnostics noise (`<PIA>`,
  `<WorkManager>`, `<Health>`, etc.) — zero session-lifecycle log lines
  (`grep -i session` returns nothing). No live HTTP session activity to track
  in this environment either.
- Both would need either real end-user browser traffic hitting PIA, or
  enabling WebLogic HTTP access + session-event logging on the domain, before
  there's anything to build against.

## Runtime Timeline

Persist runtime snapshots.

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph snapshots (creation, listing, loading, deletion, scheduled daily builds, retention pruning)
- Graph-based drift detection comparing live graph to most-recent snapshot

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02)

- Runtime history persistence: `connectors/runtimedb.py` SQLite store, 5-minute snapshot loop in scheduler
- Trend graphs (1h/6h/24h/7d sparklines) on Runtime Monitor for Active Processes, Process Errors, AE Running, IB Pending, Alerts
- Runtime snapshot creation integrated into scheduler (separate from graph snapshots)

---

## Runtime Topology

Interactive infrastructure topology.

### ✅ Completed

- App Server domain enumeration with type classification (App Server, Process Scheduler, Web/PIA, Integration Broker)
- Runtime graph visualization with force-directed layout connecting all runtime object types
- Interactive topology diagram `/admin/topology` — fixed SVG layout: Browser → nginx → WebLogic → App Server → Process Scheduler → Oracle → Integration Broker; kind-colored borders, left-edge status bars, ONLINE/OFFLINE/UNKNOWN indicators (2026-07-02)
- Live status indicators per infrastructure component — status dot top-right, left status bar, click-to-detail panel (2026-07-02)

---

## Incident Recording

Capture complete runtime incidents.

### ✅ Completed

- `connectors/incidentdb.py` (`data/incidents.db`) — `incidents` (title, env,
  severity, state, RCA window, notes) + `incident_snapshots` (source:
  rca/process/log/ash/ib/kg, JSON blob, timestamp) — full runtime state
  capture, not just a summary row
- `routers/incident.py` — `/api/incidents` CRUD + `/api/incidents/{id}/snapshot`
  (re-run RCA and attach a fresh snapshot to an existing incident)
- `routers/admin/incidents.py` — `/admin/incidents` list + `/admin/incidents/{id}`
  detail/replay page (walks back through the captured snapshots for
  post-incident troubleshooting)
- Integrated with Incident RCA (`/admin/rca`) for pre-populated capture

---

### ⚠️ Stub Providers (no live backing tables found in verified HCM schema)

Live schema verification (2026-06-30) found no SYSADM tables for these features.
All four are gracefully guarded by `has_table()` in psdb.py/graphdb.py and return empty/error results without crashing.
Marked `"stub": True` in OBJECT_REGISTRY. Table-name candidates in ptmetadata.py preserved for future investigation on other environments.

- Navigation Collections — `PTNC_COLLECTION` does not exist (PSPTPNCOLL is Push Notification Collections, 3 rows, unrelated feature)
- Event Mappings — `PSEFMAPPINGDEFN` does not exist
- Related Content — `PSRELCONDEFN` does not exist
- Drop Zones — `PSPTDZDEFN` does not exist

### ⛔ Deprioritized Providers

Investigated and deprioritized as of 2026-07-01. All are guarded by `has_table()` returns empty/stub results without crashing. Documented here for future re-evaluation on different environments or PeopleTools versions.

| Provider | Tables | Reason deprioritized |
|---|---|---|
| IB Schema Definitions | PSIBSCMADATA / PSIBSCMADFN | PSIBSCMADATA stores raw XML as CLOB chunks — not browsable; PSIBSCMADFN visible in `all_objects` but no SELECT grant in HCM; PSMSGDEFN already covers message structure |
| Navigation Collections | PTNC_COLLECTION | Does not exist in HCM; PSPTPNCOLL is Push Notification Collections (unrelated) |
| Event Mappings | PSEFMAPPINGDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| Related Content | PSRELCONDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| Drop Zones | PSPTDZDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| WorkCenters | — | No standalone definition header table; EOWC tables are runtime config keyed by portal object name |
| Dashboards | PS_EOEN_DASHBRD | 0 rows in HCM |
| BI Publisher / Branding / Page Composer | — | No backing definition tables in HCM SYSADM schema |
| Fluid Homepage / Tile Definitions | PSPGEDEFN / PSFLPGCOLLECT / PSHPDEFN / PSTILEDEFN | All absent or 0 rows in HCM |
| Activity Guide Collections | PS_AGC_TILE_TBL | 2 rows — too few to be useful |
| File Reference Definitions | PSFILEREDEFN | 19,622 rows but mostly system graphics/script refs with no descriptions; marginal value |
| Business Process Definitions | PSBUSPROCDEFN | 133 rows of legacy Workflow Navigator definitions from 2000–2002; deprecated framework |
| IB Local Schema | PSLSDEFN | 319 rows of XML schema stored as compressed binary data; display impractical |
| IB Service Setup | PSIBSVCSETUP | Single-row global IB gateway config; not a browsable catalog |

## Relationship Expansion

Continue enriching graph relationships.

### ✅ Completed

- Shared UOM relationship graph helper introduced; all in-module UOM object graph previews now use it, including Field, Record, Component, Page, Portal Registry, Operator, Role, Permission List, IB Service Operation, IB Node, IB Queue, IB Routing, SQL Definition, Tree, Component Interface, and other compact UOM previews
- Generic `/api/peoplesoft/graph/{type}/{name}` now resolves canonical object types through UOM first, so Graph Explorer compact graph previews align with Object Explorer for Record, Operator, Role, Permission List, Component, Page, Portal Registry, IB Node/Queue/Routing, Tree, CI, SQL Definition, and future UOM-backed providers
- PeopleCode and Application Engine domain graph endpoints now declare `_source`, `_vocabulary`, and `_semantics` and expose Knowledge Graph-compatible edge `type` aliases while preserving existing `relationship` labels
- Page graph API unified with UOM Page provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- Component graph API unified with UOM Component provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- CALLS, REFERENCES, USES, CONTAINS, WRAPS, SECURES edge types in active use
- Component security graph edges through Permission Lists → Roles → Operators
- Menu → Component CONTAINS edges
- CI → Component WRAPS edges
- Application Engine → Process Definition GENERATES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion
- Application Engine SQL step READS/WRITES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion, with AE section/step metadata

- PeopleCode literal SQL READS/WRITES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion for direct `SQLExec("...")` and `CreateSQL("...")` calls
- Project → object DEPLOYS edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion for safely mapped PSPROJECTITEM object types
- Project UOM object pages and compact graph previews expose the same Project → object DEPLOYS relationship model
- Persisted Knowledge Graph payloads now advertise `_source`, `_vocabulary`, and `_semantics`, and normalize edge `relationship` aliases to match UOM/domain graph contracts
- PS Query UOM objects now expose records/output fields as `_relationships` and compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Query → Record `USES`, Query → Field `EXPOSES`, and Record → Field `CONTAINS` edges for public queries
- Menu UOM compact graph previews now use the shared relationship graph helper and align Menu → Component `CONTAINS` edges with persisted Knowledge Graph semantics
- Application Package UOM objects now expose classes/PeopleCode relationships and compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Application Package → App Class `CONTAINS` edges
- Application Package PeopleCode relationships now use real PSPCMPROG `PROGSEQ` identities and persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits App Class → PeopleCode `CONTAINS` edges
- Standalone App Class UOM objects now expose package/PeopleCode relationships and compact graph previews with App Class → Package `BELONGS_TO` and App Class → PeopleCode `CONTAINS` edges
- Content Service UOM objects now expose component/menu/app-class/query/portal usage relationships and compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Content Service → target `USES` edges
- Connected Query UOM objects now expose component query and field-join relationships with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Connected Query → PS Query `USES` and parent Query → child Query `CONTAINS` edges
- XML Publisher Report UOM objects now expose datasource relationships and compact graph previews for PS Query / Connected Query data sources; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits XML Publisher Report → PS Query / Connected Query `USES` edges where `DS_TYPE` is `QRY` or `CQR`
- PTF Test UOM objects now expose menu/component/page/record/field relationships from command metadata with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits PTF Test → touched object `USES` edges
- Process Definition UOM objects now expose run-control component relationships and implementation links for Application Engine / XML Publisher process types; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Process Definition → Component `USES` and Process Definition → implementation `WRAPS` edges
- IB Message UOM objects now expose schema record relationships with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Message → Record and parent Record → child Record `CONTAINS` edges from PSMSGREC default-version metadata
- File Layout UOM objects now expose segment record and layout field relationships with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits File Layout → Record/Field and Record → Field `CONTAINS` edges from PSFLDSEGDEFN/PSFLDFIELDDEFN metadata
- ADS Definition UOM objects now expose managed record relationships with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits ADS Definition → Record and parent Record → child Record `CONTAINS` edges from PSADSDEFNITEM metadata
- Tree → Record USES edges
- Impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal with depth control)

### Remaining

- Continue aligning provider-specific Knowledge Graph ingestion with UOM
  `_relationships` / `_graph` relationship definitions — an audit (see
  "UOM/KG Alignment" below) covered ~20 of the highest-traffic provider
  types and found 9 genuine mismatches; 4 are fixed (below), 5 remain:
  `component → record` broader page-record usage, `page` subpages/security
  edges (page-level security isn't modeled in the KG at all — only
  component-level), `tree → field` edges, `component_interface → menu/
  record/field` edges, and Application Engine's `CALLS`/PeopleCode edges +
  node-type mismatch (`ae_section` vs `section` — same section has two
  different ids depending which code path built it). The remaining ~34
  provider types were not audited yet.

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-03) — UOM/KG Alignment fixes (partial)

An Explore-agent audit compared ~20 high-traffic UOM object types'
`_relationships`/`_graph` declarations against what `connectors/graphdb.py`'s
persisted-KG builders actually emit, and found 9 genuine mismatches (full
list above). Fixed the 4 lowest-risk, highest-value ones:

- **`operator → permissionlist`**: `operators()` only emitted `operator →
  role` (`OWNS`); UOM's `operator_object()` promises a direct permissionlist
  relationship too (`psdb.operator_permissionlists`). Added `HAS_PERMISSION`
  edges.
- **`role → operator`**: only the inverse (`operator → role`) existed in the
  KG, so a role page couldn't traverse to its own members. Added `role →
  operator` `HAS_MEMBER` edges via `psdb.role_users()`.
- **`service_operation ↔ node`**: UOM promises a direct sender/receiver edge;
  the KG only connected `node ↔ routing ↔ service_operation`, so reaching a
  node from a service required a 2-hop traversal through the routing. Added
  direct `node → service_operation` (`SENDS`) / `service_operation → node`
  (`RECEIVES`) edges alongside the existing routing-hop edges.
- **`portal_registry`**: had **zero KG persistence at all** — a UOM object
  type with a rich compact graph preview (breadcrumbs, children, component
  targets, permissions, access paths) but completely invisible to
  cross-references, impact analysis, and drift detection. Added
  `portal_registries()` builder persisting the folder/content-ref `CONTAINS`
  hierarchy for the top portal (by content count), bounded by `limit`.
  Component-target/permission/access-path edges are a separate follow-up,
  not attempted here — scoped to the containment tree only.
  **Found and fixed a real latent bug along the way**:
  `psdb.portal_registry_portals()`'s root-folder lookup used
  `LENGTH(TRIM(PORTAL_PRNTOBJNAME)) = 0`, but Oracle treats empty strings as
  `NULL` — so `LENGTH(NULL) = 0` never matches, and `root_objname` was
  always `None`. Fixed to `TRIM(PORTAL_PRNTOBJNAME) IS NULL` (Oracle
  correctly treats both true-NULL and whitespace-only values as NULL under
  TRIM, so this catches both).

**Verified**: fresh graph rebuild (`limit=50`) — 4,026 `HAS_PERMISSION`
edges, 568 `HAS_MEMBER` edges, 98 `SENDS`/`RECEIVES` edges, 50
`portal_registry` `CONTAINS` edges (up from 0). `make check` 91/91; smoke
test 69/69 (no admin page touched).

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-03) — Dynamic SQL READS/WRITES coverage

Closes the "non-literal PeopleCode dynamic SQL" gap. Previously,
`extract_literal_sql()` only captured `SQLExec("...", ...)` /
`CreateSQL("...")` calls whose *first argument* was an inline string
literal — `SQLExec(&strSQL, ...)` (SQL built into a variable beforehand)
produced zero READS/WRITES edges, silently dropping real table access.

- `connectors/peoplecode.py` — new `extract_dynamic_sql()`: finds
  `SQLExec(&var, ...)` / `CreateSQL(&var)` calls, then scans backward for
  every `&var = ...` / `&var = &var | ...` (self-append) assignment earlier
  in the same program, extracts the string *literal* fragments from each
  assignment's RHS (ignoring variables, function calls, `%Table()` bind
  placeholders), and concatenates them in source order into reconstructed
  SQL text. Purely textual — no expression evaluation. Returned as
  `dynamic_sql` alongside the existing `literal_sql` in `references()` /
  `references_for_program()`.
- `connectors/graphdb.py` — persisted KG ingestion loop now also processes
  `refs["dynamic_sql"]` through the existing `sql_record_access()` table
  scanner, adding `peoplecode → record` READS/WRITES edges tagged
  `source: peoplecode_dynamic_sql, confidence: low` (vs. `peoplecode_literal_sql`
  for the original single-literal-call path)
- Dynamically-chosen table names (e.g. `"FROM PS_" | &recname`) are
  correctly **not** guessed — the reconstructed text has a dangling `PS_`
  with no adjacent word characters, which the existing `PS_[A-Z0-9_]+`
  table-name regex simply doesn't match, so no edge is produced. Verified
  this directly: `sql_record_access('SELECT ... FROM PS_ WHERE ...')` →
  `{"reads": [], "writes": []}`, no false positive.

**Verified against real PeopleCode from this environment**:
`HR_JOBDATA_UTILITIES.ADDITIONALINFO.PERSONINFO.ONEXECUTE.0` builds its JOB
lookup SQL across four `&strSQL = ...` / `&strSQL = &strSQL | ...`
statements before calling `SQLExec(&strSQL, ...)` — previously invisible to
KG ingestion entirely. `extract_dynamic_sql()` correctly reconstructs the
full SQL text and `sql_record_access()` correctly derives `READS: JOB`.
`make check` 91/91; smoke test 68/68.

- Knowledge Graph Neighbors edge types: all neighbor items now show the actual edge type (CONTAINS, USES, REFERENCES, READS, …) instead of generic 'neighbor'
- Record objects: `Pages Using This Record` section — lists pages with inbound USES edges from the KG
- Record objects: `Projects Deploying This Record` section — lists projects with inbound DEPLOYS edges from the KG
- Page objects: `Projects Deploying This Page` section — lists projects with inbound DEPLOYS edges
- Component objects: `Projects Deploying This Component` section — lists projects with inbound DEPLOYS edges
- Record objects: `Queries Using This Record` section — lists PS Query definitions with USES edges (171 edges in HCM KG)
- Record objects: `PTF Tests Covering This Record` section — lists PTF automated tests with USES edges (235 edges in HCM KG)
- Generic `_attach_inbound_xref()` helper in `routers/peoplesoft.py` — reusable cross-reference builder for any (src_type, edge_type) combination; silently skips when no KG edges exist

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02)

- IB Message UOM: `Service Operations` section — operations that reference this message via PSOPERATION.MSGNAME (REST) or IB_OPERATIONNAME match (traditional IB)
- IB Message UOM: `Routings` section — routings carrying this message via PSIBRTNGDEFN.IB_OPERATIONNAME
- IB Message UOM: `Subscriptions` section — pub/sub subscriptions registered for this message (PSSUBDEFN.MSGNAME)

### Remaining

- Universal "what references me / what do I reference" coverage across all object types
- ✅ Consistent cross-reference sections for tree, portal UOM providers (Done 2026-07-03)
  - Tree: "Record Keyed by This Tree" (outbound USES → record), "Projects Deploying This Tree" (inbound DEPLOYS)
  - Portal Registry: "Projects Deploying This Portal Object", "Content Services Linking to This Portal Object"
  - Generic `_attach_outbound_xref()` helper added alongside existing `_attach_inbound_xref()`
- ✅ Consistent cross-reference sections for message UOM provider (Done 2026-07-03)
  - Message: "Records Contained in This Message" (outbound CONTAINS → record), "Projects Deploying This Message" (inbound DEPLOYS)
  - Project provider intentionally left to the generic "Knowledge Graph Neighbors" section — its DEPLOYS targets span nearly every object type, so a dedicated per-type xref section would just duplicate that list

# Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence

## Continuous Drift Detection

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph drift: compares current live graph against most-recent snapshot; surfaces new, removed, and changed nodes by type in the Graph Explorer DRIFT tab

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Knowledge Graph drift: compares current live graph against most-recent snapshot; surfaces new, removed, and changed nodes by type in the Graph Explorer DRIFT tab
- Menu comparison (`/api/envcompare/menus`) — diffs PSMENUDEFN (637 rows) including menutype, description, owner, timestamp
- Tree comparison (`/api/envcompare/trees`) — diffs PSTREEDEFN (326 rows), latest effective row per tree; shows status, description, timestamp
- IB Routing comparison (`/api/envcompare/ib_routings`) — diffs PSIBRTNGDEFN named routings (auto-generated excluded); shows type, operation, sender/receiver nodes
- IB Message comparison (`/api/envcompare/ib_messages`) — diffs PSMSGDEFN (4272 rows); shows status, description, owner
- Component Interface comparison (`/api/envcompare/ci`) — diffs PSBCDEFN; shows type, description, backing component (added 2026-07-01)
- AE step/body comparison (`/api/envcompare/ae-body`) — step-level diff; SQL text via PSAESTMTDEFN/PSSQLTEXTDEFN; unified diff per changed step (added 2026-07-01)
- Summary sidebar updated with Menus, Trees, IB Routings, IB Messages, Comp. Interfaces counts
- Environment Compare UI updated with 5 new tabs (Menus, Trees, IB Routings, IB Messages, Comp. Interfaces) + AE body drill-down within AE tab

### Remaining

- **Auto-detection from PSPROJECTDEFN**: see Promotion History section below.

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Scheduled drift reports: `driftdb.py` SQLite store + scheduler daemon integration — runs envcompare summary after each graph snapshot cycle, persists point-in-time counts, auto-generates threshold alerts (|delta| ≥ 50) and growth-rate alerts (delta grows >10%), auto-resolves when drift subsides
- `/api/drift/snapshot` (POST) — manual trigger
- `/api/drift/latest`, `/api/drift/history`, `/api/drift/alerts` (GET)
- `/admin/drift` — drift history UI with sparklines, alert table, and Snapshot Now button

---

## Environment History

Maintain historical snapshots.

### ✅ Completed

- Environment comparison across HCM and FSCM for Records, Fields, PeopleCode, SQL Definitions, PS Queries, Portals, and Knowledge Graph
- Portal object deep comparison (definition diff, children diff, permissions diff)
- Operator comparison (roles, permission lists, component access diff between two OPRIDs)

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Point-in-time runtime snapshots: every drift cycle stores a full count snapshot in `drift.db` (16 object types per environment pair, timestamped)
- Temporal history of security and metadata changes: drift history API returns per-type time series; Drift History admin page visualizes trends with delta sparklines

### ✅ Completed (Phase 1 — 2026-07-01)

- Promotion event log: `connectors/promotiondb.py` SQLite store + `routers/promotions.py` REST API
  - `POST /api/promotions` — record an event (pillar, project, from_env, to_env, date, by, notes, ticket_ref)
  - `GET /api/promotions` — list events with pillar/project/env filters
  - `GET /api/promotions/timeline` — chronological view for a single project
  - `GET /api/promotions/summary` — per-project latest promotion summary for a pillar
  - `DELETE /api/promotions/{id}` — remove a record
  - `/admin/promotions` — log form + filterable timeline table; env suggestions (DV/TST/UAT/CRP/PAR/PER/PRD)
  - Phase 1 note displayed in UI; "Promotions" added to Runtime nav group

### Remaining (Phase 2 — Future)

- **Auto-detection from PSPROJECTDEFN**: when DV/TST/UAT/PRD Oracle DB connections are added to
  `config.json`, snapshot `PSPROJECTDEFN.LASTUPDDTTM` per environment, detect when a project's
  timestamp in the target env advances to match the source env — automatically record a promotion event.
  The Phase 1 SQLite schema and API are already designed to accommodate this without structural changes.
- **Lab context**: this system is a development lab. Promotion-chain environments (DV/TST/UAT/PRD)
  do not exist yet. HCM and FSCM are separate application pillars and are NOT in a promotion chain
  with each other. Phase 2 implementation begins when real promotion-chain DB connections are available.

## Impact Forecasting

Predict downstream impact before migration.

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal, upstream/downstream node enumeration by type)
- AE restart eligibility analysis

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Pre-migration impact reports: `/admin/impact` — full project impact report with KG traversal, affected node breakdown by type, and per-object downstream count; warns when KG coverage is insufficient
- Deployment risk scoring: `/api/impact/risk` — KG-independent risk assessment using drift snapshot data; weights object types by risk (security=5×, PeopleCode/IB=4×, AE/SQL=3×, others=1×); returns per-type drift level (Minor/Moderate/Significant/Major) and overall risk label (Low/Medium/High/Critical); auto-loads on `/admin/impact` page open

# Phase 7 — AI Engineering Assistant

Leverage the knowledge graph and source search for natural-language engineering assistance.
Answer questions like "Where is employee termination implemented?", "Which AEs update PS_JOB?",
"Who has access to this component?", or "Show me the SQL definitions that touch COMPENSATION."

---

## Architecture (decided 2026-07-01)

### Provider Abstraction

All AI communication goes through a single abstract interface in `connectors/ai.py`.
Provider-specific implementations live in separate modules. Nothing above the connector
layer touches provider-specific code.

```
connectors/ai.py          ← get_provider() factory + AIProvider ABC
connectors/ai_claude.py   ← Anthropic SDK, native tool_use blocks
connectors/ai_openai.py   ← OpenAI SDK, function calling
connectors/ai_ollama.py   ← Ollama local REST API (no external key required)
connectors/ai_tools.py    ← Tool definitions wrapping existing PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence connectors
```

**Design decision:** All three providers ship at launch. Ollama enables air-gap / lab use
with no external API key. The factory pattern means adding a fourth provider later requires
only a new `ai_<name>.py` file and a config entry.

### Config Shape (`config.json`)

```json
"ai": {
  "provider": "claude",
  "claude":  { "api_key": "sk-ant-...", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" },
  "openai":  { "api_key": "sk-...",     "model": "gpt-4o" },
  "ollama":  { "base_url": "http://localhost:11434", "model": "llama3.1" }
}
```

Only the active provider's section is used at runtime. API keys may also be supplied via
environment variables (`CLAUDE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`) — env vars
take precedence over config.json values when both are present.

**Design decision:** `config.json` is the primary source (consistent with DB credentials).
Environment variable override is available for CI/container deployments.

### Tools (AI-callable PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence capabilities)

Each tool is a thin adapter over an existing connector function — no new SQL.

| Tool | Backs |
|------|-------|
| `search_objects` | `ptmetadata` global search |
| `peoplecode_search` | `peoplecode.source_search()` |
| `graph_dependencies` | `graphdb.dependency_tree()` forward |
| `graph_impact` | `graphdb.dependency_tree()` reverse |
| `who_has_access` | permlist/role/component security connectors |
| `ae_steps` | `ae.ae_steps()` |
| `sql_lookup` | `sqlws` read-only query execution |
| `envcompare_summary` | `envcompare.summary()` |
| `project_impact` | `impact.project_impact()` |

### UI — `/admin/assistant`

- Streaming chat window (SSE or chunked response)
- Provider/model badge showing active configuration
- Tool calls shown as collapsible "thinking" blocks (what was queried, what came back)
- Conversation history held in session (not persisted to disk)
- Example prompts for first-time users

---

## Natural Language Search Examples

- Where is employee termination implemented?
- Show every SQL touching PS_JOB.
- Which AEs update JOB?
- Which Components use this record?
- Who has access to the Benefits Administration component?
- What PeopleCode fires on save for PERSONAL_DATA?
- Compare security between HCM and FSCM.

---

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Architecture design and provider abstraction pattern
- Tool inventory defined (backed by existing connectors)
- Config schema defined

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- `connectors/ai.py` — `AIProvider` ABC with `chat()`, `format_tool_call_turn()`, `format_tool_results_turn()` abstract methods; `get_provider()` factory; `provider_status()` (no secrets exposed)
- `connectors/ai_claude.py` — Anthropic SDK; native tool_use content blocks; Anthropic message history format
- `connectors/ai_openai.py` — OpenAI SDK; function calling; OpenAI message history format
- `connectors/ai_ollama.py` — Ollama local REST (`/api/chat`); OpenAI-compatible tool format; no external key required
- `connectors/ai_tools.py` — 9 tool definitions + dispatch: `search_objects`, `peoplecode_search`, `graph_dependencies`, `graph_impact`, `who_has_access`, `ae_steps`, `sql_lookup`, `envcompare_summary`, `project_impact`
- `routers/assistant.py` — `POST /api/assistant/chat` (blocking + SSE streaming); agentic loop up to 8 tool rounds; `GET /api/assistant/status`
- `/admin/assistant` — Chat UI: example prompts sidebar, provider/model badge, collapsible tool-call blocks, auto-resize textarea, Enter to send
- Provider message format isolation: each provider implements its own `format_tool_call_turn()` / `format_tool_results_turn()` so the router stays provider-agnostic
- `anthropic` and `openai` packages installed in venv
- `config.json["ai"]` section with provider selection + per-provider config; env var overrides (`CLAUDE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`)
- Tested end-to-end with OpenAI GPT-4o: `search_objects` tool called, 20 records returned, synthesized answer ✓

# Phase 8 — Log Intelligence

Ingest, store, query, and AI-analyze web server and application server logs from all
PeopleSoft infrastructure tiers. Surface errors with drill-down to responsible objects
and users, and guide engineers to a fix.

---

## Architecture (decided 2026-07-01)

### Infrastructure Tiers

PeopleSoft log sources covered:

| Tier | Log type | Parser | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| F5 LTM load balancer | `f5_access` | Apache combined | HSL iRule output |
| nginx / Apache reverse proxy | `apache_access` / `apache_error` | Apache combined | Standard NCSA format |
| WebLogic PIA (web) | `pia_access` / `pia_error` | PIA NCSA extended | OPRID in auth field |
| Tuxedo App Server | `appsrv` | APPSRV format | OPRID, ORA-, PC errors |
| Tuxedo ULOG | `tuxedo` | ULOG format | Domain-level events |

### SSH Log Fetching

All log sources are remote — fetched via SSH/SFTP using paramiko.
- `ssh_hosts` in `config.json` defines reusable connection profiles (host, port, user, key or password)
- Each log source references an `ssh_host` alias
- File byte-offset tracking: only new content is fetched per cycle (no re-reading)
- Connection pool per host; auto-reconnect on failure
- Sources with `ssh_host: "local"` read files directly without SSH

### Config Shape

```json
"ssh_hosts": {
  "webserver1": { "host": "10.0.0.10", "port": 22, "username": "psadm1", "key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa" },
  "appserver1": { "host": "10.0.0.11", "port": 22, "username": "psadm1", "key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa" }
},
"log_sources": [
  { "name": "WEB1_ACCESS", "type": "pia_access",   "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "webserver1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/servers/PIA/logs/PIA_access*.log", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "WEB1_ERROR",  "type": "pia_error",    "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "webserver1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/servers/PIA/logs/PIA_stderr*.log", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "APP1",        "type": "appsrv",       "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "appserver1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/cfg/appserv/HCM/LOGS/APPSRV_*.LOG", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "APP1_TUX",   "type": "tuxedo",        "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "appserver1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/cfg/appserv/HCM/LOGS/TUXLOG.*", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "PROXY1",     "type": "apache_access",  "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "webserver1",
    "path": "/etc/nginx/logs/access.log", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "F5_LTM",     "type": "f5_access",      "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "local",
    "path": "/var/log/f5/access.log", "enabled": false }
]
```

### Storage — SQLite `data/logs.db`

```
log_sources    — source registry with last-ingest offset tracking (JSON per file)
web_entries    — parsed access log rows (oprid, component, page, status, ms, ts)
app_entries    — parsed APPSRV/ULOG rows (oprid, level, message, object_ref, ts)
log_errors     — extracted errors deduped by (source, ts, raw)
```

Indices on `ts`, `oprid`, `status`, `error_code`, `object_ref` for fast filtering.

### Session Chain Correlation

```
PSACCESSLOG (OPRID=GUACUSER, ts=10:22)
   ↓
web_entries WHERE oprid='GUACUSER' AND ts ∈ [login-15min, login+4h]
   ↓ component/page extracted from URL pattern /psp/{site}/{portal}/{node}/c/{menu}.{component}.{page}.GBL
app_entries WHERE oprid='GUACUSER' AND ts in same window
   ↓ ORA-, PeopleCode errors → extract table/component/AE names
log_errors  WHERE oprid='GUACUSER' → cross-ref with PS metadata
```

### Error Drill-Down

1. **Surface**: `/admin/log_errors` — grouped by error_code + object_ref, top-N by count
2. **Who**: which OPRIDs triggered the error, first/last seen
3. **What object**: record/component/AE name extracted from error message → links to PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence pages
4. **Fix**: "Ask AI" pre-loads the assistant with the error context; AI uses existing tools
   (`peoplecode_search`, `record_usage`, `sql_lookup`) to diagnose and suggest a fix

### AI Tools Added

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `log_search` | Search web+app entries by OPRID, time range, component, text, level |
| `log_errors` | Surface and group errors; returns error_code, object_ref, count, sample |
| `session_log_chain` | Full web→app chain for an OPRID in a time window |

### Integration Gateway Log Consumption

PeopleSoft Integration Gateway writes gateway-specific diagnostic logs that must be consumed independently from standard PIA/WebLogic logs.

Additional log sources:

| Tier | Log type | Parser | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Integration Gateway | `igw_msg_log` | IGW HTML log parser | `msgLog.html`; gateway message activity, routing, service operation details |
| Integration Gateway | `igw_error_log` | IGW HTML log parser | `errorLog.html`; gateway exceptions, target connector failures, authentication failures, routing errors |

### Config Shape — Integration Gateway Logs

Integration Gateway logs are configured independently in `config.json`, allowing each web server to define its own gateway log paths.

```json
"igw_log_sources": [
  {
    "name": "HCM_WEB1_IGW_MSG",
    "type": "igw_msg_log",
    "env": "HCM",
    "ssh_host": "hcm_web1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/applications/peoplesoft/PSIGW/msgLog.html",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "name": "HCM_WEB1_IGW_ERROR",
    "type": "igw_error_log",
    "env": "HCM",
    "ssh_host": "hcm_web1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/applications/peoplesoft/PSIGW/errorLog.html",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```

### Process Scheduler Transport Support

Process Scheduler log retrieval must support both Unix/Linux and Windows-hosted scheduler servers.

Unlike app server and web server log ingestion, Process Scheduler domains may run on:

- Linux / Unix
- Windows Server
- mixed platform deployments

Therefore `prcs_log_sources` must allow an explicit retrieval method per source.

Supported transport types:

| Transport | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| `local` | Same-host file reads |
| `ssh_sftp` | Linux/Unix Process Scheduler servers |
| `smb` | Windows Process Scheduler servers via file share |
| `winrm` | Windows Process Scheduler servers via remote command/file retrieval |
| `agent` | Future lightweight PHI collector agent installed on scheduler host |

### Updated Config Shape — Process Scheduler Logs

```json
"prcs_log_sources": [
  {
    "name": "HCM_PRCS_LINUX_DOMAIN",
    "type": "prcs_scheduler",
    "env": "HCM",
    "platform": "linux",
    "transport": "ssh_sftp",
    "ssh_host": "hcm_prcs_linux1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/cfg/appserv/prcs/HCM/LOGS/*.LOG",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "name": "HCM_PRCS_WINDOWS_OUTPUT",
    "type": "prcs_process_log",
    "env": "HCM",
    "platform": "windows",
    "transport": "smb",
    "smb_host": "hcm-prcs-win1",
    "share": "PS_CFG_HOME",
    "path": "appserv\\prcs\\HCM\\files\\log_output\\*\\*\\*.log",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "name": "HCM_PRCS_WINDOWS_TRACE",
    "type": "prcs_trace",
    "env": "HCM",
    "platform": "windows",
    "transport": "winrm",
    "winrm_host": "hcm-prcs-win1",
    "path": "C:\\psft\\pt\\8.61\\appserv\\prcs\\HCM\\files\\log_output\\*\\*\\*.tracesql",
    "enabled": false
  }
]
```

- `routers/logs.py` — REST API: sources, web, app, errors (with summary grouping), session chain, search, ingest trigger, re-extract trigger
- `routers/admin/logs.py` — `/admin/logs` (source overview), `/admin/log_errors` (grouped error surface with Ask AI), `/admin/log_viewer` (filtered web/app/error browser), `/admin/log_session` (OPRID session chain)
- AI tools: `log_search`, `log_errors`, `session_log_chain` in `connectors/ai_tools.py`
- 7+ active log sources ingesting live HCM data; error surface groups errors by code+object (HTTP_502, IB_PCODEWOL, WEBPROFILE_ERR, AUTH_FAIL, IB_EXT_APP)
- Transaction Tracing timeline: sort toggle (ascending/descending), web log entries included via `_SYSTEM_LOG_SOURCES` correlation

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — PRCS AE server log pipeline

- `connectors/logparser.py` — `parse_prcs_ae()` parser for PSAESRV Tuxedo log format; extracts AE applid → `object_ref`, process instance from message body, error detection on Status=Error / Java exceptions
- `connectors/logingest.py` — `prcs_ae` added to `_APP_TYPES`; registered in standard ingest path
- `connectors/logdb.py` — `prcs_ae_summary()` aggregates by program with run_count/error_count/date range, extracts process instance from recent error messages
- `config.json` — `HCMDMO_PRCS_AE` source ingesting `AESRV_*.LOG*` files via SSH glob; 2,604 entries ingested from 11 historical files; 4 errors (PTSF_GENFEED × 2 June 22/23)
- `routers/runtime.py` — `GET /api/runtime/process-log?env&instance` returns chronological AESRV entries for a process instance via `raw LIKE '%Process Instance=N%'`
- `routers/admin/runtime.py` — "Exec Log" tab added to Process Instance detail panel; lazily loaded on tab click; links AE programs to AE Explorer
- `routers/logs.py` — `GET /api/logs/prcs-ae-summary` endpoint
- `routers/admin/logs.py` — `/admin/prcs-ae` analytics page: stat cards, program breakdown table with error rate bar, recent errors with process instance links to Runtime Monitor

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — IGW errorLog.html pipeline

- `connectors/logparser.py` — `parse_igw_error_log()` HTML block parser; 12 regex patterns extract timestamp, description, exception, error_level, stack trace, request XML, IB operation, requesting node, HTTP status, message codes; `_IGW_ERROR_LABELS` maps exception class names to error codes (IB_EXT_APP, IB_GFW, IB_HTTP_TC, IB_EXT_CONTACT, IB_LISTEN)
- `connectors/logingest.py` — `_BLOCK_TYPES = {"igw_error_log"}` branch; processes entire HTML content, holds back partial trailing `<BODY>` block across ingest cycles
- `connectors/logdb.py` — `igw_summary()` aggregation: by error_code / IB operation / requesting node; schema migrations `idx_app_unique` (dedup) and `idx_err_unique` (multi-code per entry)
- `connectors/logdb.py` — `_SYSTEM_LOG_SOURCES` includes `"igw"` so IGW entries appear in session chain timelines
- `config.json` — `igw_log_sources` array; HCM_IGW_ERROR source ingesting `errorLog*.html` via SSH glob
- `routers/logs.py` — `GET /api/logs/igw-summary` endpoint
- `routers/admin/logs.py` — `/admin/igw` IGW Error Analytics page: stat cards, error code chips, IB operation breakdown with relative bars, requesting node breakdown with Ask AI links, recent entries table with IB Explorer cross-links
- `routers/admin/_core.py` — "IGW Errors" nav entry
- `routers/assistant.py` — AI system prompt updated: IGW error codes (IB_EXT_APP/HTTP_404 from IGW source) indicate gateway-level failures; AI guided to identify operation, node, and HTTP status from log entries
- AI diagnostic tools: `environment_health`, `ib_diagnostics`, `process_scheduler_health` added to `connectors/ai_tools.py` with proactive diagnostics system prompt

### Design Decisions

- **F5**: Supported via `f5_access` type using Apache-combined parser (HSL iRules log in NCSA format)
- **Future F5 native**: When F5 Analytics/AVR logs become available, add `f5_avr` parser with VS name, pool, irule fields
- **Retention**: 30 days of web entries, 90 days of app entries, 90 days of errors (configurable)
- **Dedup**: `log_errors` has `UNIQUE(source_name, ts, coalesce(raw,''), coalesce(error_code,''))` — allows multiple error codes per entry; `app_entries` has `UNIQUE(source_name, ts, coalesce(raw,''))` — safe to re-ingest overlapping byte ranges
- **OPRID extraction**: web logs — second NCSA field (auth user); app logs — context field + message body fallback
- **IGW raw field format**: pipe-delimited `ts|description|exception|ib_operation|requesting_node` (≤500 chars) — parsed server-side for analytics grouping
- **msgLog.html** (`igw_msg_log` type): Not implemented — message logging disabled in this HCM environment; no file present to parse against

# Phase 9 — Platform Extensibility

## Plugin SDK

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-03) — v1

Full design in the approved plan (`connectors/plugins.py` docstring / this
section). Every extension surface investigated turned out to be the same
shape: a hardcoded literal list/dict/if-chain only core code could append
to. Solved by adding one appendable registry per surface, plus a loader.

- **`connectors/plugins.py`** — four registries + `register_*`/`get_*`
  functions: object providers, graph providers, runtime providers, nav
  entries (+ router registration). Pure Python, no FastAPI/DB imports at
  module scope.
- **`connectors/pluginloader.py`** — `discover_and_load(app, plugins_dir=
  "plugins")`: imports every `plugins/<name>.py` or `plugins/<name>/
  __init__.py`, calls `register(sdk)`. Isolated per-plugin try/except — a
  broken plugin logs a warning and is skipped, never crashes startup or
  affects other plugins (verified: deliberately broke the example plugin's
  syntax, confirmed the server still started and every other admin page
  still returned 200, then restored it).
- **Wiring** (each is a small, additive change, zero risk to existing
  built-in types/pages):
  - `routers/peoplesoft.py` `object_payload()` checks
    `plugins.get_object_provider(type)` before the existing 50+-branch
    if/elif chain
  - `connectors/graphdb.py` `build()` appends `plugins.get_graph_providers()`
    to its literal provider tuple (each loader wrapped so it receives
    `(graph, env, limit)`, matching the zero-arg `loader()` contract the
    existing closures rely on)
  - `routers/runtime.py` — generic `GET /api/runtime/plugins` (list) and
    `GET /api/runtime/plugins/{name}` (fetch); `routers/admin/runtime.py`
    "Plugin Providers" card renders any registered provider automatically
    (generic JSON dump — no per-plugin UI code needed)
  - `routers/admin/_core.py` `_nav_html()` merges `_NAV_GROUPS` with
    `plugins.get_nav_entries()` (new group label creates a new dropdown,
    e.g. "Plugins")
  - `main.py` `lifespan()` calls `pluginloader.discover_and_load(app)` once
    at startup, before `scheduler.start()`
- **`plugins/example_hello.py`** — worked example exercising all four
  registries with trivial in-memory data (no DB/SSH), meant as a copy-paste
  starting point. Verified end-to-end through the *running server*
  (not just unit-level): `/admin/plugin/hello` renders, appears in nav under
  a new "Plugins" group; `GET /api/peoplesoft/object/hello_widget/ALPHA`
  returns a real payload; `GET /api/runtime/plugins/hello` returns live
  status; `POST /api/graph/build?env=HCM&limit=50` produces real
  `hello_widget:*` nodes/edges in the persisted KG JSON.
- **`PLUGINS.md`** (repo root) — the actual SDK documentation: each
  extension point with a code snippet, loading/isolation semantics, and an
  explicit "not yet covered" section (see below).

**v2 candidates, not built now** (documented in `PLUGINS.md`): custom health
checks (no registry yet — a plugin's runtime provider is a reasonable stand-in
today), and a dedicated "config-driven source" registry for plugins that want
to replicate the SQR/COBOL ingest pattern (object-provider + graph-provider
registries are sufficient building blocks for this already, just not formalized
into their own registration API).

**Verified**: `make check` 91/91; `python3 scripts/smoke_admin_shell.py`
69/69 (including the new `/admin/plugin/hello` entry).

# Phase 10 — Source Artifact Intelligence

## Vision

Extend PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence beyond Oracle metadata by incorporating filesystem-based source artifacts into the Digital Twin.

SQR, COBOL, COPYBOOK, and SQC files become first-class UOM objects that fully participate in search, graph traversal, dependency analysis, environment comparison, runtime correlation, and AI engineering workflows.

---

## Source Discovery

### Done (2026-07-02)

- Configurable `sqr_sources` in config.json (alias, dir, label, key)
- SSH-based filesystem discovery via existing `sshclient.py` pool
- FSCM SQR library indexed: 507 SQR + 698 SQC = 1,205 files
- 2,019 distinct PS_ tables, 5,183 table references, 9,142 #include references
- Background re-index via `POST /api/sqr/ingest` with polling at `/api/sqr/ingest/status`
- `connectors/sqrparser.py` — pure parser (description, release, revision, tables, includes, procedures)
- `connectors/sqrdb.py` — SQLite at data/sqr.db (sqr_programs, sqr_tables, sqr_includes, sqr_procedures)
- `connectors/sqringest.py` — SSH-based indexer

### Planned

- Incremental scanning (checksum-based change detection)
- Custom override layer detection (custom dir vs delivered dir)
- HCM-specific SQR directories
- Configurable custom source roots

---

## Source Explorer

### Done (2026-07-02)

- `/admin/sqr` — list view with search, type filter (SQR/SQC), pagination, stat cards, Re-index button
- `/admin/sqr/{filename}` — program detail: metadata, PS_ tables with operation badges, #include tree, procedures list
- `/admin/sqr/table/{PS_TABLE}` — which programs reference a given table and how (SELECT/UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE)
- `GET /api/sqr/programs`, `GET /api/sqr/program/{filename}`, `GET /api/sqr/table/{name}`, `GET /api/sqr/sqc/{name}/users`
- Nav entry under Platform → SQR Explorer

### Done (2026-07-02)

- Source preview tab in program detail (live SSH fetch, SQR syntax highlighting: comments, #include, begin/end sections, SQL keywords, SQR keywords)
- `GET /api/sqr/program/{filename}/source` — live SSH source fetch (up to 512KB)

### Done (2026-07-02 pass 2)

- `/admin/sqr/analytics` — Top 30 PS_ tables by reference count, top 20 most complex SQR programs, top 20 most-included SQC files, release breakdown (1,200 FSCM92 + 5 others)
- `GET /api/sqr/analytics` — analytics data endpoint
- `sqr_program` added to OBJECT_REGISTRY — icon, display_title, graph_node_type; Object Explorer `/admin/object/sqr_program/{name}` → 302 redirect to `/admin/sqr/{name}.sqr`
- Runtime process instance panel — SQR Report/Process type now shows "SQR Source" link next to program name, linking directly to `/admin/sqr/{prcsname}.sqr`
- Analytics button added to SQR Explorer toolbar

### Planned

(none remaining — see COBOL/Copybook Explorer below)

### ✅ Done (2026-07-03)

- **SQR Include Dependency Graph** — `/admin/sqrdeps?q=` page with collapsible forward
  include tree, reverse "Included By" panel (direct + indirect), and force-directed
  canvas graph
- `GET /api/sqr/deps/{filename}` — recursive CTE forward + reverse traversal with DISTINCT
- `connectors/sqrdb.get_include_deps()` — recursive CTE traversal
- **SQR Environment Side-by-Side Comparison** — `/admin/sqrcompare` with 4 tabs (Changed /
  Only A / Only B / Identical); `GET /api/sqr/envcompare`; compares table counts, include
  counts, and MD5 content hashes
- **Incremental SQR Scanning** — MD5 `content_hash` column in `sqr_programs`; ingestor
  skips unchanged files (hash match); `skipped` count in ingest summary

---

## Override Intelligence

- setenv.sqc has 495 SQR programs as reverse-dependencies

### Planned

- COBOL COPY library dependencies
- Application Engine launch references
- External executable references

---

## Search

### ✅ Done (2026-07-02) — SQR Source Full-Text Search

- `source_text TEXT` column added to `sqr_programs` via schema migration in `init_db()`; also fixed stale FK references in sub-tables that pointed to dropped `sqr_programs_v1`
- `sqringest.py` now passes `content` (full source) to `upsert_program(source_text=content)` — populated on each re-index
- `sqrdb.search_source(q, file_type, source_key, limit)` — LIKE search, deduplicates by filename, returns per-file hit count + up to 5 snippet contexts with line numbers
- `sqrdb.source_index_status()` — returns indexed/total/pct for UI progress display
- `GET /api/sqr/search?q=&type=&source_key=&limit=` and `GET /api/sqr/search/status` in `routers/sqr.py`
- `/admin/sqrsearch` in `routers/admin/sqr_view.py`: sidebar results sorted by hit count, inline source viewer with SQR syntax highlighting and term highlighting; "Open in SQR Explorer" cross-link per result; re-index notice when not yet indexed

---

# Phase — Processing Sequence Intelligence

## Goal

Teach PHI how PeopleSoft processing flows execute over time.

PHI should understand event order, execution context, and sequence-sensitive behavior across PeopleCode, component processing, save processing, integration activity, and batch handoffs.

## Completed

- Unified Object Model foundation exists
- Object Explorer exists
- Graph Explorer exists
- Knowledge Graph foundation exists
- PeopleCode metadata extraction exists or is planned as part of metadata intelligence
- Runtime Monitor and Oracle ASH integration provide a foundation for later runtime correlation

## ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — Component Event Flow

- `/admin/compflow` — Component Event Flow Explorer: enter any component name (autocomplete search), view all PeopleCode events grouped by phase (Search/Build/Interaction/Save/Other); click any event row to expand inline PeopleCode source with full syntax highlighting; modification detection shows user-modified events; record cross-links to Record Explorer; env-aware
- `GET /api/peoplesoft/components/{comp}/events?env=` — returns all PSPCMPROG rows for objectid1∈{9,10} for the component; decodes phase, scope (Component/Record/Field), record, field, event name, lastupdoprid/dttm; also returns component OBJECTOWNERID from PSPNLGRPDEFN
- `GET /api/peoplesoft/components/{comp}/event-source?env=&event=&record=&field=` — fetches PeopleCode source text from PSPCMTXT for the specific event; matches on objectvalue columns to narrow to the exact program
- Both functions in `connectors/peoplecode.py`: `component_events()` and `component_event_source()`

## ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — Incident RCA

- `/admin/rca` — Incident RCA dashboard: select time window (15m/1h/4h/24h quick buttons or custom datetime-local inputs), pick Oracle DB for ASH data, click Investigate; correlated view across Process Failures, Log Errors, Oracle ASH, IB Errors; summary stat cards, timeline list, cross-links to Runtime Monitor and IB Explorer
- `GET /api/runtime/rca?env=&start=&end=&db=` — `rca_snapshot()` in execution.py correlates PSPRCSRQST failures, logdb errors, V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY, and PSAPMSGPUBHDR IB errors into a single time-windowed report with unified timeline

## ✅ Completed (2026-07-03) — v1 slice

Two of the six ambitions below turned out to already be half-built:
`/admin/compseq` had a complete, correct canonical 20-event ordered
sequence (4 phases, named events + purpose notes) — but only as a
hardcoded JS array, invisible to anything else. This pass moved it
server-side and connected it to two consumers.

- **Event-Aware Metadata Indexing (Component context)**:
  `connectors/peoplecode.py` `CANONICAL_COMPONENT_SEQUENCE` (the same
  4-phase ordered event data, now a real Python artifact) +
  `component_sequence(env, comp)` — slots a component's actual PeopleCode
  events into canonical order, marking each slot empty/delivered/custom.
  `GET /api/peoplesoft/components/{comp}/sequence?env=` exposes it.
  `/admin/compseq`'s JS array is intentionally left as-is (verified, working
  page — no functional gain from rewiring its rendering in this pass); the
  new backend function is what other consumers use.
- **Sequence-Aware Graph Relationships**: new `component_event` KG node
  type (id `<COMPONENT>.<EVENT_NAME>`) with `FIRES_BEFORE`/`FIRES_AFTER`
  edges (metadata: phase, ordinal, status) between consecutive non-empty
  canonical events, plus `BELONGS_TO` edges to the existing `component`
  node type. `connectors/graphdb.py` `component_sequences()` builder,
  bounded by `limit` like every other provider. **Bug found and fixed
  during verification**: multiple raw PSPCMPROG rows sharing one canonical
  event (e.g. `RowInit` firing for 7 different records) each got their own
  slot but collapsed to the same node id, producing self-loop
  `FIRES_BEFORE`/`FIRES_AFTER` edges — fixed by deduplicating to one node
  per distinct event name before building the sequence chain.
- **AI-Assisted Sequence Explanation (data only, no new UI)**: fixed a
  real duplicate-code bug found along the way — the AI assistant's
  `component_events` tool (`connectors/ai_tools.py`) was calling a stale,
  less-complete duplicate (`psdb.get_component_peoplecode_events`) instead
  of the richer `connectors/peoplecode.py:component_events()` that actually
  backs `/admin/compflow`. Now calls the real function directly and
  enriches its result with canonical phase/ordinal context from
  `component_sequence()`, so the assistant can answer ordering questions
  ("what fires before save?") using real sequence data, not just a
  phase→count summary. No new AI plumbing needed — one more `_HANDLERS`
  entry following the existing 3-step registration pattern.

**Verified**: `PERSONAL_DATA` component — 41 raw PSPCMPROG rows slot into
exactly 41 non-empty canonical positions (zero data loss/duplication);
graph rebuild (`limit=50`) produced 38 `component_event` nodes / 38
FIRES_BEFORE+FIRES_AFTER edges with zero self-loops after the fix; a
component with no PeopleCode (`HR_JOB_TREE_BLDR`) correctly produces zero
non-empty slots and zero graph edges, no crash; AI tool wiring confirmed
via direct call, no longer errors, includes real sequence context.
`make check` 91/91; smoke test 69/69 (no admin page touched — a pure
regression check, not new UI coverage).

**Explicitly deferred, not silently dropped** (see remaining ambitions
below for full description):

- **Processing Path Explorer** for Page/Field/Record/CI/Transaction-path
  contexts — only Component is handled (the only context with existing
  rich canonical-sequence data)
- **Delivered vs Custom Sequence Comparison** beyond the existing
  `LASTUPDOPRID` heuristic already wired into `/admin/compflow`/`compseq` —
  PeopleCode has no delivered-source baseline to diff against (unlike
  SQR/COBOL, which have real parallel delivered+custom source trees via
  `source_type` in `sqringest.py`/`cobolingest.py`)
- **Runtime Trace Correlation** tying processing sequence to live
  PIA/session traces — blocked on missing data in this environment
  (confirmed via SSH: 0-byte `PIA_access.log`, no session-lifecycle events
  in `PIA_weblogic.log` — same root cause as the Browser/WebLogic session
  tracking blocker documented under Phase 4 above). Oracle ASH
  (`oracle_ash_for_process` in `execution.py`) and AE/Process-Scheduler logs
  ARE populated and already power `/admin/rca` — a narrower "AE runtime
  trace correlation" (not tied to PeopleCode component events specifically,
  since PeopleCode execution isn't traced anywhere in this environment) is
  viable as a separate future slice if wanted.

## Remaining ambitions (not built this pass — see above for what shipped instead)

### Event-Aware Metadata Indexing

Index PeopleCode by execution context:

- Component
- Page
- Record
- Field
- Component record
- Component record field
- Event name
- Sequence phase
- Save phase
- Runtime interaction phase

### Sequence-Aware Graph Relationships

Extend the Knowledge Graph with ordered processing relationships:

- `FIRES_BEFORE`
- `FIRES_AFTER`
- `PART_OF_SEQUENCE`
- `CALLS_DURING_EVENT`
- `VALIDATES_BEFORE_SAVE`
- `MUTATES_BUFFER`
- `MUTATES_DATABASE`
- `BLOCKS_PROCESSING`
- `TRIGGERS_RUNTIME_ACTION`

### Processing Path Explorer

Create a UI that shows ordered execution flow for:

- Component
- Page
- Field
- Record
- Component Interface
- Transaction path

The explorer should show which PeopleCode, Application Packages, SQL, Message Catalog entries, integrations, and batch handoffs participate at each point in the sequence.

### Delivered vs Custom Sequence Comparison

Add comparison tools that show how custom logic changes delivered processing behavior.

Capabilities:

- Detect custom PeopleCode additions
- Detect delivered PeopleCode changes
- Compare delivered vs custom source
- Show custom logic in sequence position
- Highlight risky event placements
- Flag upgrade impact where delivered sequence behavior changed

### Runtime Trace Correlation

Correlate static processing paths with runtime evidence.

Target inputs:

- PeopleCode trace
- SQL trace
- PIA access/session activity
- Oracle ASH
- Integration Broker monitor data
- Process Scheduler logs
- Application Engine/SQR/COBOL execution logs

### AI-Assisted Sequence Explanation

Add AI-assisted explanations for selected processing paths.

Example questions PHI should answer:

- What happens when this component opens?
- What happens when this field changes?
- What validates before save?
- What can prevent this transaction from saving?
- What runs after save?
- Where is this custom logic inserted into delivered processing?
- What downstream integrations or batch processes can be triggered?

---

# Long-Term Goals

PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence should become the definitive engineering, observability, and operational intelligence platform for PeopleSoft environments.

---

# Current Focus

## ✅ Phase 5 — Complete (as of 2026-07-01)

Phase 5 Knowledge Graph coverage is complete. 23 new providers were added across multiple sessions. All viable tables have been implemented; all unimplementable tables are documented in the Deprioritized Providers table above with reasons.

**IB Schema Definitions** (PSIBSCMADATA / PSIBSCMADFN) was the last candidate. Investigated 2026-07-01: no SELECT grant exists in HCM; PSIBSCMADATA stores raw XML as CLOB chunks — not browsable even with grants; PSIBSCMADFN header is redundant with existing PSMSGDEFN coverage. Deprioritized.

**Provider methodology for future sessions:**
1. Query `all_tab_columns` to find the real table and column names — never assume PeopleTools naming
2. Pull live sample rows to confirm usable keys and human-readable content
3. Write psdb.py → ptmetadata.py → graphdb.py → uom.py → routers/peoplesoft.py → routers/admin/<group>.py in order
4. Compile-check and smoke-test at each layer before proceeding
5. Document deprioritization reasons when tables are unimplementable

## ✅ Phase 7 — AI Engineering Assistant (Complete as of 2026-07-01)

3-provider AI assistant (Claude / OpenAI / Ollama) with 12+ tool definitions backed by live connectors.
Streaming chat at `/admin/assistant`; agentic tool loop up to 8 rounds; collapsible tool-call blocks.
Tools: `search_objects`, `peoplecode_search`, `graph_dependencies`, `graph_impact`, `who_has_access`,
`ae_steps`, `sql_lookup`, `envcompare_summary`, `project_impact`, `active_sessions`, `record_usage`,
`log_search`, `log_errors`, `session_log_chain`, `environment_health`, `ib_diagnostics`, `process_scheduler_health`.

## ✅ Phase 8 — Log Intelligence (Complete as of 2026-07-02)

Full log ingestion pipeline: PIA access/error, APPSRV, Tuxedo, nginx/Apache, F5, IGW errorLog.html, PRCS AE AESRV logs.
SSH/SFTP fetch with byte-offset tracking; 60s ingest cycle; SQLite `data/logs.db`.
Admin pages: `/admin/logs`, `/admin/log_errors`, `/admin/log_viewer`, `/admin/log_session`, `/admin/igw`, `/admin/prcs-ae`.
AI tools for log diagnosis; session chain correlation web→app; error surface with Ask AI deep-links.

**Remaining:** Process Scheduler log ingestion for Windows-hosted schedulers (SMB/WinRM transport) — blocked until a Windows scheduler server is available.

## ✅ Component Processing Sequence Timeline (2026-07-02)

- `/admin/compseq` — PC Timeline: enter component name (same autocomplete as compflow), renders canonical PeopleSoft processing lifecycle in 4 phase columns (Search → Build → Interaction → Save)
- Each of the 20 canonical event slots rendered as a card: cyan if delivered PC exists, amber if custom PC, dark-grey if empty; click to expand inline source with PeopleCode syntax highlighting
- Summary stats bar: Total Slots (20), With PeopleCode, Custom Events, Delivered Events, Empty Slots
- Per-program source fetch via /api/peoplesoft/components/{comp}/event-source (up to 6 per event); custom programs show lastupdoprid in amber
- Event metadata includes canonical scope (Component/Record/Field), purpose note, program count, and record names involved
- "PC Timeline" added to Platform nav and home page Quick Navigation
- Addresses Processing Sequence Intelligence roadmap: Event-Aware Metadata Indexing (the canonical sequence view exposes event execution context), Delivered vs Custom comparison (custom badge + source expansion)

## ✅ What Changed Expansion + Security Audit (2026-07-02)

- **What Changed** expanded from 9 → 20 object types: Records, Components, Pages, AE Programs, Fields, PeopleCode, SQL Defs, Perm Lists, Roles (original 9) + Menus (PSMENUDEFN), Queries (PSQRYDEFN), Projects (PSPROJECTDEFN.descrlong), Processes (PS_PRCSDEFN), App Packages (PSPACKAGEDEFN), IB Messages (PSMSGDEFN), IB Routings (PSIBRTNGDEFN, filtered ~GENERATED~), Trees (PSTREEDEFN.tree_name), Translate Values (PSXLATITEM GROUP BY fieldname), Component Interfaces (PSBCDEFN)
- **OPRID filter** added to What Changed toolbar — client-side filter on the `op` column shows N/Total counts per type pill when active; empty filter string shows all results; filter applies immediately on input without re-querying
- **Security Audit Dashboard** at `/admin/secaudit`: stat cards (total operators/roles/PLs/active-30d), top roles by member count, top operators by role count, recent sign-ons (30d), orphaned roles panel, operator type breakdown; all via POST /api/sqlws/execute
- **Security nav group** consolidates secaudit/security/operator/role/permissionlist; permissionlist moved from Objects
- **SQR cross-reference in Record Explorer** — record UOM calls sqrdb.get_programs_for_table(table_name); "SQR Programs" section with _links.admin → /admin/sqr/{filename}; re-index triggered 2026-07-03 — 344 rows, 123 distinct tables

## ✅ Phase 10 — SQR Explorer (Substantially Complete as of 2026-07-02)

SQR/SQC source artifact intelligence is live for FSCM (507 SQR + 698 SQC = 1,205 files indexed).
Admin pages: `/admin/sqr`, `/admin/sqr/{filename}`, `/admin/sqr/table/{table}`, `/admin/sqr/analytics`, `/admin/sqrsearch`.
KG edges: `sqr_program → record` READS/WRITES, `sqr_program → sqr_program` INCLUDES, `prcs_defn → sqr_program` WRAPS.
Runtime process panel: SQR Report/Process type links directly to source.

### Done (2026-07-02, session 3)

- **SQR Override Intelligence infrastructure**: `sqr_sources` keys split per source_type (`fscm_sqr_delivered` / `fscm_sqr_custom` / `hcm_sqr_delivered` / `hcm_sqr_custom`); `source_type: delivered|custom` field added to config; sqrdb schema migrated to `UNIQUE(filename, source_key)` + `source_type` column; `GET /api/sqr/overrides?env=` returns filenames present in both delivered and custom; re-index required to populate source_type in DB
- **SQR KG Records tab**: all detail pages now have a "KG Records" lazy-load tab; queries `/api/graph/neighbors/sqr_program:FILE?env=HCM`; renders READS (blue) / WRITES (amber) groups with links to Record Explorer
- **SQR Full-Text Search** at `/admin/sqrsearch`: SQLite-backed source text index with automatic schema migration; syntax-highlighted snippets; deduplication across delivered/custom trees; cross-link to SQR Explorer
- **EnvCompare Process Definitions tab**: `GET /api/envcompare/process_definitions` compares PS_PRCSDEFN (PRCSTYPE, PRCSNAME, DESCR, LASTUPDDTTM) using composite TYPE~NAME key; "Processes" tab in EnvCompare UI between Trees and IB Routings
- **EnvCompare summary**: Process Definitions count row added (PS_PRCSDEFN)
- **Env-based filtering** in SQR Explorer: env selector dropdown populated from `/api/sqr/sources`; stats and search results scoped to selected env
- **SQC Included By tab**: SQC detail pages show a third "Included By" tab listing programs that #include this SQC (lazy-loaded from `/api/sqr/sqc/{name}/users`)

### ✅ Done (2026-07-03) — COBOL/Copybook Explorer

- **`cobol_sources`** config block added: 4 entries (HCM/FSCM × delivered/custom),
  each with `cbl_src_dir` and `cbl_compiled_dir`
- **Discovery**: PeopleSoft COBOL "copybooks" are `.cbl` files distinguished by the
  *absence* of `PROGRAM-ID` (they're pulled in via `COPY name.` — e.g. `COPY PTCLOGMS.`
  targets `PTCLOGMS.cbl`), not a separate `.cpy` extension. No true `.cpy` files exist
  in this environment. `connectors/cobolparser.py` classifies `file_type` as
  `program`/`copybook` on that basis, and description extraction skips past the fixed
  Oracle license preamble (bounded by an "All Rights Reserved." marker) plus decorative
  box-border comment lines before taking the first real comment as description.
  Also extracts static `CALL 'X'` targets and `EXEC SQL ... END-EXEC` PS_ table refs.
- **`connectors/cobol_db.py`** (`data/cobol.db`): `cobol_programs`/`cobol_tables`/
  `cobol_copies`/`cobol_calls`; recursive-CTE `get_copy_deps()` (forward + reverse
  COPY closure, joining on filename-minus-extension since COPY names target files,
  not parsed member names); MD5 `content_hash` for incremental scanning; full-text
  `search_source()`
- **`connectors/cobolingest.py`**: SSH scan of `cbl_src_dir` (`*.cbl`); best-effort
  listing of `cbl_compiled_dir` to flag whether a compiled binary exists; per-file
  `PermissionError` is counted as `denied` and never raised — most delivered `.cbl`
  files are mode 700 (owner `ps_hcm`, not readable by the `oracle` SSH service
  account) and this is expected, not an error
  (confirmed: 862/977 denied, 115/977 indexed per environment)
- **`routers/cobol.py`**: `/api/cobol/{stats,sources,programs,program/{f},
  program/{f}/source,table/{t},deps/{f},search,search/status,ingest,ingest/status}`
- **`/admin/cobol`** (Platform nav) list/search page + **`/admin/cobol/{filename}`**
  detail page (Overview / COPY Dependency Graph / Source tabs)
- **`hcm_cobol_src_custom`/`fscm_cobol_src_custom`** sources point at
  `ps_cust_home/src/cbl`, which doesn't exist on this demo box (`ps_cust_home` only
  has an `sqr` folder) — ingestor reports `cbl_src_dir not found` as a warning, not
  a crash; will populate automatically once a real customer environment has custom
  COBOL

**Verified**: fresh ingest → 230 files indexed (88 programs, 142 copybooks) across
HCM+FSCM delivered; `PTPCBLAE.cbl` → 8 direct COPY deps resolved correctly;
`PTCALOGM.cbl` correctly classified as copybook (`ZM000-LOG-MESSAGE` SECTION, no
PROGRAM-ID) with description "CALL THE MESSAGE LOGGER WITH A TRANSACTION EDIT
MESSAGE." (license-preamble-skipping fix verified); `make check` 91/91;
`python3 scripts/smoke_admin_shell.py` 68/68.

**Remaining:** environment side-by-side SQR comparison (done — see `/admin/sqrcompare`
above); no true copybook (`.cpy`) support was needed since none exist in this
PeopleSoft install, but the schema's `file_type` column already generalizes to that
case if a future customer environment has them.

### ✅ Done (2026-07-03, session 2) — COBOL Knowledge Graph wiring

- New `cobol_program` KG node type: `connectors/graphdb.py` `cobol_programs()` builder
  (registered in the env build list) adds `cobol_program → record` READS/WRITES edges
  (from EXEC SQL table refs), `cobol_program → cobol_program` COPIES edges, and
  `cobol_program → cobol_program` CALLS edges (static `CALL 'X'` targets — dynamic
  `CALL WS-VAR` calls can't be resolved and are skipped, same limitation as SQR's
  `DO`/`GOSUB` handling)
- `connectors/ptmetadata.py` `OBJECT_REGISTRY["cobol_program"]` entry (icon,
  `object_page: /admin/cobol`, relationships) — mirrors the existing `sqr_program` entry
- `routers/admin/graph.py` `/admin/object/cobol_program/{name}` redirects to
  `/admin/cobol/{name}.cbl`, matching the `sqr_program` → `/admin/sqr/{name}` pattern

**Verified**: fresh `graphdb.build(env='HCM', limit=2000)` produced 163 `cobol_program`
nodes and 567 edges (164 CALLS, 403 COPIES; 0 READS/WRITES since none of the 115
readable delivered `.cbl` files use `EXEC SQL`); `/api/graph/neighbors/cobol_program:
PTCALOGM.CBL` resolves real CALLS edges to `PTPLOGMS.CBL`/`PTPTEDIT.CBL`; redirect
`/admin/object/cobol_program/PTCALOGM.CBL` → `/admin/cobol/ptcalogm.cbl` (302);
`make check` 91/91; smoke test 68/68.

## ✅ Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence (Substantially Complete as of 2026-07-01)

Continuous drift detection, environment history, and impact forecasting are complete.

**Remaining:** Promotion history tracking (DEV → TEST → UAT → PROD) — needs real promotion-chain DB connections before implementation.

**What was delivered:**
- 17-type envcompare coverage (records, fields, components, pages, permissions, roles, AE, PeopleCode, SQL defs, portals, queries, menus, trees, IB routings, IB messages, comp. interfaces, **process definitions**)
- AE step-level body comparison with unified SQL diff
- Scheduled drift snapshots (SQLite) with threshold + growth alerts, history time series
- KG-independent deployment risk scoring (weighted by object type) via `/api/impact/risk`
- Project impact reports via KG reverse traversal via `/api/impact/project`
- Admin pages: `/admin/drift`, `/admin/impact`

## ✅ Dedicated Object Explorers (2026-07-02)

Rich dedicated explorer pages for major PeopleSoft object types, providing deep contextual analysis beyond the generic Object Explorer.

- **AE Explorer** at `/admin/ae`: search catalog, tabbed detail (Overview, Steps, Runtime History, Cross-References, KG Graph); live runtime history from Process Scheduler; step/section/SQL deep dive; Invoked By (Process Definitions) cross-reference
- **Component Explorer** at `/admin/component`: tabbed analysis — Overview, Pages, Security, PeopleCode, Portal, Records; Who Has Access (complete PL → Role → Operator chain); grouped PeopleCode by event; component-to-page cross-linking
- **Page Explorer** at `/admin/page`: Overview, Records, Components, PeopleCode, Security; hierarchical page/subpage navigation
- **Permission List Explorer** at `/admin/permissionlist`: Overview, Components, Roles, Menus; access coverage analysis
- **Unified Object Explorer** at `/admin/object/{type}/{name}`: cross-type search; auto-redirects to dedicated explorer for supported types; generic UOM provider view for all other types
- Cross-linking updated throughout platform: AE/Component/Page/Permission List deep-links from process definitions, runtime monitor, record explorer, security explorer

## ✅ Component Event Flow Explorer (2026-07-02)

- `/admin/compflow`: enter component, renders canonical PeopleSoft processing lifecycle (20 event slots across 4 phases: Search → Build → Interaction → Save); each slot shows delivered/custom PeopleCode with inline source viewer and syntax highlighting; custom events highlighted in amber with LASTUPDOPRID
- `/api/peoplesoft/components/{comp}/events`: enumerate component, record, and field-level PeopleCode events with execution phase, scope, customization status; decode 20 canonical events with purpose/phase metadata
- `/api/peoplesoft/components/{comp}/event-source`: fetch PeopleCode source for specific event context from PSPCMTXT
- Inline source viewer within event flow; SQR syntax highlighting for PeopleCode
- Addressed Processing Sequence Intelligence roadmap: canonical event sequence model, event-aware indexing, delivered vs custom comparison

## ✅ Incident RCA (2026-07-02)

- `/admin/rca`: single-pane root-cause analysis; correlates process failure with Oracle ASH, app/web logs, IB errors, and Knowledge Graph; tabbed output (Process, Logs, ASH, IB, KG); pre-populated from runtime process panel
- Integrated with Component Event Flow for PeopleCode-level correlation

## ✅ SQR Full-Text Search (2026-07-02)

- `/admin/sqrsearch`: SQLite-backed source text index; search across all indexed SQR/SQC source code; syntax-highlighted snippets with matching term highlight; sorted by hit count; deduplication across delivered/custom; "Open in SQR Explorer" cross-link per result
- Schema migration for source text column applied automatically on first use

## ✅ Access Path Explorer (2026-07-02)

- `/admin/access` (Security nav group): dual-mode security analysis — component-centric (who can access this component?) and operator-centric (what can this operator access?)
- Component mode: complete Permission List → Role → Operator authorization paths; access level breakdown; count summary
- Operator mode: component permissions, access levels, and granting security objects
- Environment-aware; URL deep-linking; client-side filtering for rapid security investigation

## ✅ Change Risk Analyzer (2026-07-02)

- `/admin/riskanalysis` (Tools nav group): evaluate project impact, blast radius, and affected users before deployment; computes risk scores based on affected records, components, AE programs, and user population
- Direct navigation from risk results to Component Explorer, Record Explorer, and Access Path Explorer
- IB Message cross-references: UOM IB Message objects now show correlated Service Operations, Routings, and Subscriptions

## ✅ Security Audit Dashboard (2026-07-02)

- `/admin/secaudit`: stat cards (total operators/roles/PLs/active-30d), top roles by member count, top operators by role count, recent sign-ons (30d), orphaned roles, operator type breakdown
- Security nav group consolidates: Security Audit, Security Explorer, Operators, Roles, Permission Lists

## ✅ What Changed Expansion (2026-07-02)

Expanded from 9 → 20 supported object types: added Menus, Queries, Projects, Processes, App Packages, IB Messages, IB Routings, Trees, Translate Values, Component Interfaces.
OPRID filter added: client-side filter on updater shows N/Total counts per type pill.

## ✅ SQR Cross-References in Record Explorer (2026-07-02)

Record objects now have a "SQR Programs" section (sourced from `sqrdb.get_programs_for_table()`); shows which SQR programs read or write this record with operation badges and links to SQR Explorer.

## ✅ Field PeopleCode Impact Tab (2026-07-02)

`/admin/field/{name}` now has a "PeopleCode" tab alongside Records/Keyed/ByType: shows all PeopleCode programs that reference this field, grouped by object type (Record/Component/Page), with event name and direct links to source.
