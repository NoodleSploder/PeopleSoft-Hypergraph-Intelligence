# Phase 4 — Runtime Intelligence

## Live Session Explorer

Provide complete end-to-end session visibility.

### ✅ Completed

- SQL execution visibility and top-SQL analysis
- Wait events and Oracle ASH integration
- Lock analysis and blocking chains
- Process Scheduler linkage and instance deep-linking
- Integration Broker activity and queue depth

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — Operational Dashboard

- `/admin/` home page replaced with a live operational dashboard; auto-refreshes every 60s
- **Active Alerts panel** — calls `GET /api/runtime/alerts`; shows all active alerts with severity badges and deep-links; green "All Clear" when 0 alerts
- **Runtime Health panel** — calls `GET /api/runtime/status`; shows process total/active/error, AE running, IB pending with color-coded values
- **Log Intelligence panel** — aggregates source count, source errors, PRCS AE error count, IGW error total; shows last ingest timestamp
- **Environment & Trends panel** — drift alert count vs FSCM; 6h runtime metric sparklines (Active, Errors, IB, Alerts) from runtimedb history
- **Quick Navigation** — 16 deep-links to every major platform section in one bar
- Log-based alert checks added to `connectors/alerts.py`: `_check_igw_errors()` (IGW spike >20/h), `_check_log_error_spike()` (non-IGW errors >30/h), `_check_prcs_ae_failures()` (PRCS AE failures in last 24h), `_check_error_trend()` (runtimedb trend detection: process_error going from 0→N)

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — Runtime History Persistence

- `connectors/runtimedb.py` — SQLite store at `data/runtime.db`; one row per 5-minute scheduler cycle per env; columns: process_active, process_error, process_total, ae_running, ib_pending, alert_count; `record()`, `get_history()`, `prune()` (30-day retention)
- `connectors/scheduler.py` — `_runtime_snapshot_loop()` thread (5-minute interval); calls process_status_summary + ib_queue_summary + evaluate_alerts; records to runtimedb; integrated into `start()`/`stop()`/`status()`
- `routers/runtime.py` — `GET /api/runtime/history?env&hours` time-series endpoint; `GET /api/runtime/history/snapshot` manual trigger
- `routers/admin/runtime.py` — "Metrics History" card on Runtime Monitor: 1h/6h/24h/7d period selector; sparkline SVG charts for Active Processes, Process Errors, AE Running, IB Pending, Alerts; trend arrows (↑↓→) colored by whether the metric increasing is good or bad; `loadHistory()` called on every refresh cycle

### Remaining

- Browser session tracking
- WebLogic session tracking
- App Server process tracking beyond domain enumeration

---

## Runtime Timeline

### ⚠️ Stub Providers (no live backing tables found in verified HCM schema)

Live schema verification (2026-06-30) found no SYSADM tables for these features.
All four are gracefully guarded by `has_table()` in psdb.py/graphdb.py and return empty/error results without crashing.
Marked `"stub": True` in OBJECT_REGISTRY. Table-name candidates in ptmetadata.py preserved for future investigation on other environments.

- Navigation Collections — `PTNC_COLLECTION` does not exist (PSPTPNCOLL is Push Notification Collections, 3 rows, unrelated feature)
- Event Mappings — `PSEFMAPPINGDEFN` does not exist
- Related Content — `PSRELCONDEFN` does not exist
- Drop Zones — `PSPTDZDEFN` does not exist

### ⛔ Deprioritized Providers

Investigated and deprioritized as of 2026-07-01. All are guarded by `has_table()` returns empty/stub results without crashing. Documented here for future re-evaluation on different environments or PeopleTools versions.

| Provider | Tables | Reason deprioritized |
|---|---|---|
| IB Schema Definitions | PSIBSCMADATA / PSIBSCMADFN | PSIBSCMADATA stores raw XML as CLOB chunks — not browsable; PSIBSCMADFN visible in `all_objects` but no SELECT grant in HCM; PSMSGDEFN already covers message structure |
| Navigation Collections | PTNC_COLLECTION | Does not exist in HCM; PSPTPNCOLL is Push Notification Collections (unrelated) |
| Event Mappings | PSEFMAPPINGDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| Related Content | PSRELCONDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| Drop Zones | PSPTDZDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| WorkCenters | — | No standalone definition header table; EOWC tables are runtime config keyed by portal object name |
| Dashboards | PS_EOEN_DASHBRD | 0 rows in HCM |
| BI Publisher / Branding / Page Composer | — | No backing definition tables in HCM SYSADM schema |
| Fluid Homepage / Tile Definitions | PSPGEDEFN / PSFLPGCOLLECT / PSHPDEFN / PSTILEDEFN | All absent or 0 rows in HCM |
| Activity Guide Collections | PS_AGC_TILE_TBL | 2 rows — too few to be useful |
| File Reference Definitions | PSFILEREDEFN | 19,622 rows but mostly system graphics/script refs with no descriptions; marginal value |
| Business Process Definitions | PSBUSPROCDEFN | 133 rows of legacy Workflow Navigator definitions from 2000–2002; deprecated framework |
| IB Local Schema | PSLSDEFN | 319 rows of XML schema stored as compressed binary data; display impractical |
| IB Service Setup | PSIBSVCSETUP | Single-row global IB gateway config; not a browsable catalog |

## Relationship Expansion

Continue enriching graph relationships.

### ✅ Completed

- Shared UOM relationship graph helper introduced; all in-module UOM object graph previews now use it, including Field, Record, Component, Page, Portal Registry, Operator, Role, Permission List, IB Service Operation, IB Node, IB Queue, IB Routing, SQL Definition, Tree, Component Interface, and other compact UOM previews
- Generic `/api/peoplesoft/graph/{type}/{name}` now resolves canonical object types through UOM first, so Graph Explorer compact graph previews align with Object Explorer for Record, Operator, Role, Permission List, Component, Page, Portal Registry, IB Node/Queue/Routing, Tree, CI, SQL Definition, and future UOM-backed providers
- PeopleCode and Application Engine domain graph endpoints now declare `_source`, `_vocabulary`, and `_semantics` and expose Knowledge Graph-compatible edge `type` aliases while preserving existing `relationship` labels
- Page graph API unified with UOM Page provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- Component graph API unified with UOM Component provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- CALLS, REFERENCES, USES, CONTAINS, WRAPS, SECURES edge types in active use
- Component security graph edges through Permission Lists → Roles → Operators
- Menu → Component CONTAINS edges
- CI → Component WRAPS edges
- Application Engine → Process Definition GENERATES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion
- Application Engine SQL step READS/WRITES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion, with AE section/step metadata

- PeopleCode literal SQL READS/WRITES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion for direct `SQLExec("...")` and `CreateSQL("...")` calls
- Project → object DEPLOYS edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion for safely mapped PSPROJECTITEM object types
- Project UOM object pages and compact graph previews expose the same Project → object DEPLOYS relationship model
- Persisted Knowledge Graph payloads now advertise `_source`, `_vocabulary`, and `_semantics`, and normalize edge `relationship` aliases to match UOM/domain graph contracts
- PS Query UOM objects now expose records/output fields as `_relationships` and compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Query → Record `USES`, Query → Field `EXPOSES`, and Record → Field `CONTAINS` edges for public queries
- Menu UOM compact graph previews now use the shared relationship graph helper and align Menu → Component `CONTAINS` edges with persisted Knowledge Graph semantics
- Application Package UOM objects now expose classes/PeopleCode relationships and compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Application Package → App Class `CONTAINS` edges
- Application Package PeopleCode relationships now use real PSPCMPROG `PROGSEQ` identities and persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits App Class → PeopleCode `CONTAINS` edges
- Standalone App Class UOM objects now expose package/PeopleCode relationships and compact graph previews with App Class → Package `BELONGS_TO` and App Class → PeopleCode `CONTAINS` edges
- Content Service UOM objects now expose component/menu/app-class/query/portal usage relationships and compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Content Service → target `USES` edges
- Connected Query UOM objects now expose component query and field-join relationships with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Connected Query → PS Query `USES` and parent Query → child Query `CONTAINS` edges
- XML Publisher Report UOM objects now expose datasource relationships and compact graph previews for PS Query / Connected Query data sources; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits XML Publisher Report → PS Query / Connected Query `USES` edges where `DS_TYPE` is `QRY` or `CQR`
- PTF Test UOM objects now expose menu/component/page/record/field relationships from command metadata with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits PTF Test → touched object `USES` edges
- Process Definition UOM objects now expose run-control component relationships and implementation links for Application Engine / XML Publisher process types; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Process Definition → Component `USES` and Process Definition → implementation `WRAPS` edges
- IB Message UOM objects now expose schema record relationships with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Message → Record and parent Record → child Record `CONTAINS` edges from PSMSGREC default-version metadata
- File Layout UOM objects now expose segment record and layout field relationships with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits File Layout → Record/Field and Record → Field `CONTAINS` edges from PSFLDSEGDEFN/PSFLDFIELDDEFN metadata
- ADS Definition UOM objects now expose managed record relationships with compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits ADS Definition → Record and parent Record → child Record `CONTAINS` edges from PSADSDEFNITEM metadata
- Tree → Record USES edges
- Impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal with depth control)

### Remaining

- Continue aligning provider-specific Knowledge Graph ingestion with UOM `_relationships` / `_graph` relationship definitions
- Broader READS/WRITES coverage for non-literal PeopleCode dynamic SQL

## Cross References

Every object should answer:

### ✅ Completed

- What references me? (implemented for AE SQL steps via `%SQL()`, PeopleCode source references, SQL cross-references)
- What do I reference? (implemented for Components, Pages, Records, AE programs, Portal Registry)
- Who secures me? (implemented for Components, Pages, Permission Lists, Portal Registry with access-path visualization)
- What breaks if I change? (impact analysis via Knowledge Graph traversal)
- Child records, subrecord derivations, and AE state records for Record objects

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02)

- Record objects: `READS / WRITES` section — lists every AE/SQL/PeopleCode program that reads or writes this record, sourced from Knowledge Graph inbound READS/WRITES edges; WRITES-first sort
- Record objects: `Components Using This Record` section — lists components with inbound USES edges from the KG; surfaces components that reference this record as search/data record
- Application Engine objects: `Records Read / Written` section — lists every record touched by this AE, sourced from outbound READS/WRITES KG edges
- Application Engine objects: `Invoked By (Process Definitions)` section — lists process scheduler definitions that wrap/invoke this AE via inbound WRAPS KG edges
- SQL Definition objects: `Records Read / Written` section — lists records accessed by this SQL definition, sourced from outbound READS/WRITES KG edges
- PeopleCode objects: `Records Read / Written` section — lists records accessed by PeopleCode programs with READS edges in the KG
- Knowledge Graph Neighbors edge types: all neighbor items now show the actual edge type (CONTAINS, USES, REFERENCES, READS, …) instead of generic 'neighbor'
- Record objects: `Pages Using This Record` section — lists pages with inbound USES edges from the KG

### Remaining

- Universal "what references me / what do I reference" coverage across all object types
- Consistent cross-reference sections across remaining UOM providers (message, tree, project, portal)

---

# Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence

## Continuous Drift Detection

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph drift: compares current live graph against most-recent snapshot; surfaces new, removed, and changed nodes by type in the Graph Explorer DRIFT tab

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Knowledge Graph drift: compares current live graph against most-recent snapshot; surfaces new, removed, and changed nodes by type in the Graph Explorer DRIFT tab
- Menu comparison (`/api/envcompare/menus`) — diffs PSMENUDEFN (637 rows) including menutype, description, owner, timestamp
- Tree comparison (`/api/envcompare/trees`) — diffs PSTREEDEFN (326 rows), latest effective row per tree; shows status, description, timestamp
- IB Routing comparison (`/api/envcompare/ib_routings`) — diffs PSIBRTNGDEFN named routings (auto-generated excluded); shows type, operation, sender/receiver nodes
- IB Message comparison (`/api/envcompare/ib_messages`) — diffs PSMSGDEFN (4272 rows); shows status, description, owner
- Component Interface comparison (`/api/envcompare/ci`) — diffs PSBCDEFN; shows type, description, backing component (added 2026-07-01)
- AE step/body comparison (`/api/envcompare/ae-body`) — step-level diff; SQL text via PSAESTMTDEFN/PSSQLTEXTDEFN; unified diff per changed step (added 2026-07-01)
- Summary sidebar updated with Menus, Trees, IB Routings, IB Messages, Comp. Interfaces counts
- Environment Compare UI updated with 5 new tabs (Menus, Trees, IB Routings, IB Messages, Comp. Interfaces) + AE body drill-down within AE tab

### Remaining

- **Auto-detection from PSPROJECTDEFN**: see Promotion History section below.

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Scheduled drift reports: `driftdb.py` SQLite store + scheduler daemon integration — runs envcompare summary after each graph snapshot cycle, persists point-in-time counts, auto-generates threshold alerts (|delta| ≥ 50) and growth-rate alerts (delta grows >10%), auto-resolves when drift subsides
- `/api/drift/snapshot` (POST) — manual trigger
- `/api/drift/latest`, `/api/drift/history`, `/api/drift/alerts` (GET)
- `/admin/drift` — drift history UI with sparklines, alert table, and Snapshot Now button

---

## Environment History

Maintain historical snapshots.

### ✅ Completed

- Environment comparison across HCM and FSCM for Records, Fields, PeopleCode, SQL Definitions, PS Queries, Portals, and Knowledge Graph
- Portal object deep comparison (definition diff, children diff, permissions diff)
- Operator comparison (roles, permission lists, component access diff between two OPRIDs)

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Point-in-time runtime snapshots: every drift cycle stores a full count snapshot in `drift.db` (16 object types per environment pair, timestamped)
- Temporal history of security and metadata changes: drift history API returns per-type time series; Drift History admin page visualizes trends with delta sparklines

### ✅ Completed (Phase 1 — 2026-07-01)

- Promotion event log: `connectors/promotiondb.py` SQLite store + `routers/promotions.py` REST API
  - `POST /api/promotions` — record an event (pillar, project, from_env, to_env, date, by, notes, ticket_ref)
  - `GET /api/promotions` — list events with pillar/project/env filters
  - `GET /api/promotions/timeline` — chronological view for a single project
  - `GET /api/promotions/summary` — per-project latest promotion summary for a pillar
  - `DELETE /api/promotions/{id}` — remove a record
  - `/admin/promotions` — log form + filterable timeline table; env suggestions (DV/TST/UAT/CRP/PAR/PER/PRD)
  - Phase 1 note displayed in UI; "Promotions" added to Runtime nav group

### Remaining (Phase 2 — Future)

- **Auto-detection from PSPROJECTDEFN**: when DV/TST/UAT/PRD Oracle DB connections are added to
  `config.json`, snapshot `PSPROJECTDEFN.LASTUPDDTTM` per environment, detect when a project's
  timestamp in the target env advances to match the source env — automatically record a promotion event.
  The Phase 1 SQLite schema and API are already designed to accommodate this without structural changes.
- **Lab context**: this system is a development lab. Promotion-chain environments (DV/TST/UAT/PRD)
  do not exist yet. HCM and FSCM are separate application pillars and are NOT in a promotion chain
  with each other. Phase 2 implementation begins when real promotion-chain DB connections are available.

## Impact Forecasting

Predict downstream impact before migration.

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal, upstream/downstream node enumeration by type)
- AE restart eligibility analysis

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Pre-migration impact reports: `/admin/impact` — full project impact report with KG traversal, affected node breakdown by type, and per-object downstream count; warns when KG coverage is insufficient
- Deployment risk scoring: `/api/impact/risk` — KG-independent risk assessment using drift snapshot data; weights object types by risk (security=5×, PeopleCode/IB=4×, AE/SQL=3×, others=1×); returns per-type drift level (Minor/Moderate/Significant/Major) and overall risk label (Low/Medium/High/Critical); auto-loads on `/admin/impact` page open

---

# Phase 7 — AI Engineering Assistant

Leverage the knowledge graph and source search for natural-language engineering assistance.
Answer questions like "Where is employee termination implemented?", "Which AEs update PS_JOB?",
"Who has access to this component?", or "Show me the SQL definitions that touch COMPENSATION."

---

## Architecture (decided 2026-07-01)

### Provider Abstraction

All AI communication goes through a single abstract interface in `connectors/ai.py`.
Provider-specific implementations live in separate modules. Nothing above the connector
layer touches provider-specific code.

```
connectors/ai.py          ← get_provider() factory + AIProvider ABC
connectors/ai_claude.py   ← Anthropic SDK, native tool_use blocks
connectors/ai_openai.py   ← OpenAI SDK, function calling
connectors/ai_ollama.py   ← Ollama local REST API (no external key required)
connectors/ai_tools.py    ← Tool definitions wrapping existing PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence connectors
```

**Design decision:** All three providers ship at launch. Ollama enables air-gap / lab use
with no external API key. The factory pattern means adding a fourth provider later requires
only a new `ai_<name>.py` file and a config entry.

### Config Shape (`config.json`)

```json
"ai": {
  "provider": "claude",
  "claude":  { "api_key": "sk-ant-...", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" },
  "openai":  { "api_key": "sk-...",     "model": "gpt-4o" },
  "ollama":  { "base_url": "http://localhost:11434", "model": "llama3.1" }
}
```

Only the active provider's section is used at runtime. API keys may also be supplied via
environment variables (`CLAUDE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`) — env vars
take precedence over config.json values when both are present.

**Design decision:** `config.json` is the primary source (consistent with DB credentials).
Environment variable override is available for CI/container deployments.

### Tools (AI-callable PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence capabilities)

Each tool is a thin adapter over an existing connector function — no new SQL.

| Tool | Backs |
|------|-------|
| `search_objects` | `ptmetadata` global search |
| `peoplecode_search` | `peoplecode.source_search()` |
| `graph_dependencies` | `graphdb.dependency_tree()` forward |
| `graph_impact` | `graphdb.dependency_tree()` reverse |
| `who_has_access` | permlist/role/component security connectors |
| `ae_steps` | `ae.ae_steps()` |
| `sql_lookup` | `sqlws` read-only query execution |
| `envcompare_summary` | `envcompare.summary()` |
| `project_impact` | `impact.project_impact()` |

### UI — `/admin/assistant`

- Streaming chat window (SSE or chunked response)
- Provider/model badge showing active configuration
- Tool calls shown as collapsible "thinking" blocks (what was queried, what came back)
- Conversation history held in session (not persisted to disk)
- Example prompts for first-time users

---

## Natural Language Search Examples

- Where is employee termination implemented?
- Show every SQL touching PS_JOB.
- Which AEs update JOB?
- Which Components use this record?
- Who has access to the Benefits Administration component?
- What PeopleCode fires on save for PERSONAL_DATA?
- Compare security between HCM and FSCM.

---

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Architecture design and provider abstraction pattern
- Tool inventory defined (backed by existing connectors)
- Config schema defined

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- `connectors/ai.py` — `AIProvider` ABC with `chat()`, `format_tool_call_turn()`, `format_tool_results_turn()` abstract methods; `get_provider()` factory; `provider_status()` (no secrets exposed)
- `connectors/ai_claude.py` — Anthropic SDK; native tool_use content blocks; Anthropic message history format
- `connectors/ai_openai.py` — OpenAI SDK; function calling; OpenAI message history format
- `connectors/ai_ollama.py` — Ollama local REST (`/api/chat`); OpenAI-compatible tool format; no external key required
- `connectors/ai_tools.py` — 9 tool definitions + dispatch: `search_objects`, `peoplecode_search`, `graph_dependencies`, `graph_impact`, `who_has_access`, `ae_steps`, `sql_lookup`, `envcompare_summary`, `project_impact`
- `routers/assistant.py` — `POST /api/assistant/chat` (blocking + SSE streaming); agentic loop up to 8 tool rounds; `GET /api/assistant/status`
- `/admin/assistant` — Chat UI: example prompts sidebar, provider/model badge, collapsible tool-call blocks, auto-resize textarea, Enter to send
- Provider message format isolation: each provider implements its own `format_tool_call_turn()` / `format_tool_results_turn()` so the router stays provider-agnostic
- `anthropic` and `openai` packages installed in venv
- `config.json["ai"]` section with provider selection + per-provider config; env var overrides (`CLAUDE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`)
- Tested end-to-end with OpenAI GPT-4o: `search_objects` tool called, 20 records returned, synthesized answer ✓

# Phase 8 — Log Intelligence

Ingest, store, query, and AI-analyze web server and application server logs from all
PeopleSoft infrastructure tiers. Surface errors with drill-down to responsible objects
and users, and guide engineers to a fix.

---

## Architecture (decided 2026-07-01)

### Infrastructure Tiers

PeopleSoft log sources covered:

| Tier | Log type | Parser | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| F5 LTM load balancer | `f5_access` | Apache combined | HSL iRule output |
| nginx / Apache reverse proxy | `apache_access` / `apache_error` | Apache combined | Standard NCSA format |
| WebLogic PIA (web) | `pia_access` / `pia_error` | PIA NCSA extended | OPRID in auth field |
| Tuxedo App Server | `appsrv` | APPSRV format | OPRID, ORA-, PC errors |
| Tuxedo ULOG | `tuxedo` | ULOG format | Domain-level events |

### SSH Log Fetching

All log sources are remote — fetched via SSH/SFTP using paramiko.
- `ssh_hosts` in `config.json` defines reusable connection profiles (host, port, user, key or password)
- Each log source references an `ssh_host` alias
- File byte-offset tracking: only new content is fetched per cycle (no re-reading)
- Connection pool per host; auto-reconnect on failure
- Sources with `ssh_host: "local"` read files directly without SSH

### Config Shape

```json
"ssh_hosts": {
  "webserver1": { "host": "10.0.0.10", "port": 22, "username": "psadm1", "key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa" },
  "appserver1": { "host": "10.0.0.11", "port": 22, "username": "psadm1", "key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa" }
},
"log_sources": [
  { "name": "WEB1_ACCESS", "type": "pia_access",   "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "webserver1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/servers/PIA/logs/PIA_access*.log", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "WEB1_ERROR",  "type": "pia_error",    "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "webserver1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/servers/PIA/logs/PIA_stderr*.log", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "APP1",        "type": "appsrv",       "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "appserver1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/cfg/appserv/HCM/LOGS/APPSRV_*.LOG", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "APP1_TUX",   "type": "tuxedo",        "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "appserver1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/cfg/appserv/HCM/LOGS/TUXLOG.*", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "PROXY1",     "type": "apache_access",  "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "webserver1",
    "path": "/etc/nginx/logs/access.log", "enabled": true },
  { "name": "F5_LTM",     "type": "f5_access",      "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "local",
    "path": "/var/log/f5/access.log", "enabled": false }
]
```

### Storage — SQLite `data/logs.db`

```
log_sources    — source registry with last-ingest offset tracking (JSON per file)
web_entries    — parsed access log rows (oprid, component, page, status, ms, ts)
app_entries    — parsed APPSRV/ULOG rows (oprid, level, message, object_ref, ts)
log_errors     — extracted errors deduped by (source, ts, raw)
```

Indices on `ts`, `oprid`, `status`, `error_code`, `object_ref` for fast filtering.

### Session Chain Correlation

```
PSACCESSLOG (OPRID=GUACUSER, ts=10:22)
   ↓
web_entries WHERE oprid='GUACUSER' AND ts ∈ [login-15min, login+4h]
   ↓ component/page extracted from URL pattern /psp/{site}/{portal}/{node}/c/{menu}.{component}.{page}.GBL
app_entries WHERE oprid='GUACUSER' AND ts in same window
   ↓ ORA-, PeopleCode errors → extract table/component/AE names
log_errors  WHERE oprid='GUACUSER' → cross-ref with PS metadata
```

### Error Drill-Down

1. **Surface**: `/admin/log_errors` — grouped by error_code + object_ref, top-N by count
2. **Who**: which OPRIDs triggered the error, first/last seen
3. **What object**: record/component/AE name extracted from error message → links to PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence pages
4. **Fix**: "Ask AI" pre-loads the assistant with the error context; AI uses existing tools
   (`peoplecode_search`, `record_usage`, `sql_lookup`) to diagnose and suggest a fix

### AI Tools Added

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `log_search` | Search web+app entries by OPRID, time range, component, text, level |
| `log_errors` | Surface and group errors; returns error_code, object_ref, count, sample |
| `session_log_chain` | Full web→app chain for an OPRID in a time window |

### Integration Gateway Log Consumption

PeopleSoft Integration Gateway writes gateway-specific diagnostic logs that must be consumed independently from standard PIA/WebLogic logs.

Additional log sources:

| Tier | Log type | Parser | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Integration Gateway | `igw_msg_log` | IGW HTML log parser | `msgLog.html`; gateway message activity, routing, service operation details |
| Integration Gateway | `igw_error_log` | IGW HTML log parser | `errorLog.html`; gateway exceptions, target connector failures, authentication failures, routing errors |

### Config Shape — Integration Gateway Logs

Integration Gateway logs are configured independently in `config.json`, allowing each web server to define its own gateway log paths.

```json
"igw_log_sources": [
  {
    "name": "HCM_WEB1_IGW_MSG",
    "type": "igw_msg_log",
    "env": "HCM",
    "ssh_host": "hcm_web1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/applications/peoplesoft/PSIGW/msgLog.html",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "name": "HCM_WEB1_IGW_ERROR",
    "type": "igw_error_log",
    "env": "HCM",
    "ssh_host": "hcm_web1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/applications/peoplesoft/PSIGW/errorLog.html",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```

### Process Scheduler Transport Support

Process Scheduler log retrieval must support both Unix/Linux and Windows-hosted scheduler servers.

Unlike app server and web server log ingestion, Process Scheduler domains may run on:

- Linux / Unix
- Windows Server
- mixed platform deployments

Therefore `prcs_log_sources` must allow an explicit retrieval method per source.

Supported transport types:

| Transport | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| `local` | Same-host file reads |
| `ssh_sftp` | Linux/Unix Process Scheduler servers |
| `smb` | Windows Process Scheduler servers via file share |
| `winrm` | Windows Process Scheduler servers via remote command/file retrieval |
| `agent` | Future lightweight PHI collector agent installed on scheduler host |

### Updated Config Shape — Process Scheduler Logs

```json
"prcs_log_sources": [
  {
    "name": "HCM_PRCS_LINUX_DOMAIN",
    "type": "prcs_scheduler",
    "env": "HCM",
    "platform": "linux",
    "transport": "ssh_sftp",
    "ssh_host": "hcm_prcs_linux1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/cfg/appserv/prcs/HCM/LOGS/*.LOG",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "name": "HCM_PRCS_WINDOWS_OUTPUT",
    "type": "prcs_process_log",
    "env": "HCM",
    "platform": "windows",
    "transport": "smb",
    "smb_host": "hcm-prcs-win1",
    "share": "PS_CFG_HOME",
    "path": "appserv\\prcs\\HCM\\files\\log_output\\*\\*\\*.log",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "name": "HCM_PRCS_WINDOWS_TRACE",
    "type": "prcs_trace",
    "env": "HCM",
    "platform": "windows",
    "transport": "winrm",
    "winrm_host": "hcm-prcs-win1",
    "path": "C:\\psft\\pt\\8.61\\appserv\\prcs\\HCM\\files\\log_output\\*\\*\\*.tracesql",
    "enabled": false
  }
]
```

- AI tools: `log_search`, `log_errors`, `session_log_chain` in `connectors/ai_tools.py`
- 7+ active log sources ingesting live HCM data; error surface groups errors by code+object (HTTP_502, IB_PCODEWOL, WEBPROFILE_ERR, AUTH_FAIL, IB_EXT_APP)
- Transaction Tracing timeline: sort toggle (ascending/descending), web log entries included via `_SYSTEM_LOG_SOURCES` correlation

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — PRCS AE server log pipeline

- `connectors/logparser.py` — `parse_prcs_ae()` parser for PSAESRV Tuxedo log format; extracts AE applid → `object_ref`, process instance from message body, error detection on Status=Error / Java exceptions
- `connectors/logingest.py` — `prcs_ae` added to `_APP_TYPES`; registered in standard ingest path
- `connectors/logdb.py` — `prcs_ae_summary()` aggregates by program with run_count/error_count/date range, extracts process instance from recent error messages
- `config.json` — `HCMDMO_PRCS_AE` source ingesting `AESRV_*.LOG*` files via SSH glob; 2,604 entries ingested from 11 historical files; 4 errors (PTSF_GENFEED × 2 June 22/23)
- `routers/runtime.py` — `GET /api/runtime/process-log?env&instance` returns chronological AESRV entries for a process instance via `raw LIKE '%Process Instance=N%'`
- `routers/admin/runtime.py` — "Exec Log" tab added to Process Instance detail panel; lazily loaded on tab click; links AE programs to AE Explorer
- `routers/logs.py` — `GET /api/logs/prcs-ae-summary` endpoint
- `routers/admin/logs.py` — `/admin/prcs-ae` analytics page: stat cards, program breakdown table with error rate bar, recent errors with process instance links to Runtime Monitor

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — IGW errorLog.html pipeline

- `connectors/logparser.py` — `parse_igw_error_log()` HTML block parser; 12 regex patterns extract timestamp, description, exception, error_level, stack trace, request XML, IB operation, requesting node, HTTP status, message codes; `_IGW_ERROR_LABELS` maps exception class names to error codes (IB_EXT_APP, IB_GFW, IB_HTTP_TC, IB_EXT_CONTACT, IB_LISTEN)
- `connectors/logingest.py` — `_BLOCK_TYPES = {"igw_error_log"}` branch; processes entire HTML content, holds back partial trailing `<BODY>` block across ingest cycles
- `connectors/logdb.py` — `igw_summary()` aggregation: by error_code / IB operation / requesting node; schema migrations `idx_app_unique` (dedup) and `idx_err_unique` (multi-code per entry)
- `connectors/logdb.py` — `_SYSTEM_LOG_SOURCES` includes `"igw"` so IGW entries appear in session chain timelines
- `config.json` — `igw_log_sources` array; HCM_IGW_ERROR source ingesting `errorLog*.html` via SSH glob
- `routers/logs.py` — `GET /api/logs/igw-summary` endpoint
- `routers/admin/logs.py` — `/admin/igw` IGW Error Analytics page: stat cards, error code chips, IB operation breakdown with relative bars, requesting node breakdown with Ask AI links, recent entries table with IB Explorer cross-links
- `routers/admin/_core.py` — "IGW Errors" nav entry
- `routers/assistant.py` — AI system prompt updated: IGW error codes (IB_EXT_APP/HTTP_404 from IGW source) indicate gateway-level failures; AI guided to identify operation, node, and HTTP status from log entries
- AI diagnostic tools: `environment_health`, `ib_diagnostics`, `process_scheduler_health` added to `connectors/ai_tools.py` with proactive diagnostics system prompt

### Design Decisions

- **F5**: Supported via `f5_access` type using Apache-combined parser (HSL iRules log in NCSA format)
- **Future F5 native**: When F5 Analytics/AVR logs become available, add `f5_avr` parser with VS name, pool, irule fields
- **Retention**: 30 days of web entries, 90 days of app entries, 90 days of errors (configurable)
- **Dedup**: `log_errors` has `UNIQUE(source_name, ts, coalesce(raw,''), coalesce(error_code,''))` — allows multiple error codes per entry; `app_entries` has `UNIQUE(source_name, ts, coalesce(raw,''))` — safe to re-ingest overlapping byte ranges
- **OPRID extraction**: web logs — second NCSA field (auth user); app logs — context field + message body fallback
- **IGW raw field format**: pipe-delimited `ts|description|exception|ib_operation|requesting_node` (≤500 chars) — parsed server-side for analytics grouping
- **msgLog.html** (`igw_msg_log` type): Not implemented — message logging disabled in this HCM environment; no file present to parse against

# Phase — Processing Sequence Intelligence

## Goal

Teach PHI how PeopleSoft processing flows execute over time.

PHI should understand event order, execution context, and sequence-sensitive behavior across PeopleCode, component processing, save processing, integration activity, and batch handoffs.

## Completed

- Unified Object Model foundation exists
- Object Explorer exists
- Graph Explorer exists
- Knowledge Graph foundation exists
- PeopleCode metadata extraction exists or is planned as part of metadata intelligence
- Runtime Monitor and Oracle ASH integration provide a foundation for later runtime correlation

## ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — Component Event Flow

- `/admin/compflow` — Component Event Flow Explorer: enter any component name (autocomplete search), view all PeopleCode events grouped by phase (Search/Build/Interaction/Save/Other); click any event row to expand inline PeopleCode source with full syntax highlighting; modification detection shows user-modified events; record cross-links to Record Explorer; env-aware
- `GET /api/peoplesoft/components/{comp}/events?env=` — returns all PSPCMPROG rows for objectid1∈{9,10} for the component; decodes phase, scope (Component/Record/Field), record, field, event name, lastupdoprid/dttm; also returns component OBJECTOWNERID from PSPNLGRPDEFN
- `GET /api/peoplesoft/components/{comp}/event-source?env=&event=&record=&field=` — fetches PeopleCode source text from PSPCMTXT for the specific event; matches on objectvalue columns to narrow to the exact program
- Both functions in `connectors/peoplecode.py`: `component_events()` and `component_event_source()`

## ✅ Completed (2026-07-02) — Incident RCA

- `/admin/rca` — Incident RCA dashboard: select time window (15m/1h/4h/24h quick buttons or custom datetime-local inputs), pick Oracle DB for ASH data, click Investigate; correlated view across Process Failures, Log Errors, Oracle ASH, IB Errors; summary stat cards, timeline list, cross-links to Runtime Monitor and IB Explorer
- `GET /api/runtime/rca?env=&start=&end=&db=` — `rca_snapshot()` in execution.py correlates PSPRCSRQST failures, logdb errors, V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY, and PSAPMSGPUBHDR IB errors into a single time-windowed report with unified timeline

## Remaining

### Event-Aware Metadata Indexing

Index PeopleCode by execution context:

- Component
- Page
- Record
- Field
- Component record
- Component record field
- Event name
- Sequence phase
- Save phase
- Runtime interaction phase

### Sequence-Aware Graph Relationships

Extend the Knowledge Graph with ordered processing relationships:

- `FIRES_BEFORE`
- `FIRES_AFTER`
- `PART_OF_SEQUENCE`
- `CALLS_DURING_EVENT`
- `VALIDATES_BEFORE_SAVE`
- `MUTATES_BUFFER`
- `MUTATES_DATABASE`
- `BLOCKS_PROCESSING`
- `TRIGGERS_RUNTIME_ACTION`

### Processing Path Explorer

Create a UI that shows ordered execution flow for:

- Component
- Page
- Field
- Record
- Component Interface
- Transaction path

The explorer should show which PeopleCode, Application Packages, SQL, Message Catalog entries, integrations, and batch handoffs participate at each point in the sequence.

### Delivered vs Custom Sequence Comparison

Add comparison tools that show how custom logic changes delivered processing behavior.

Capabilities:

- Detect custom PeopleCode additions
- Detect delivered PeopleCode changes
- Compare delivered vs custom source
- Show custom logic in sequence position
- Highlight risky event placements
- Flag upgrade impact where delivered sequence behavior changed

### Runtime Trace Correlation

Correlate static processing paths with runtime evidence.

Target inputs:

- PeopleCode trace
- SQL trace
- PIA access/session activity
- Oracle ASH
- Integration Broker monitor data
- Process Scheduler logs
- Application Engine/SQR/COBOL execution logs

### AI-Assisted Sequence Explanation

Add AI-assisted explanations for selected processing paths.

Example questions PHI should answer:

- What happens when this component opens?
- What happens when this field changes?
- What validates before save?
- What can prevent this transaction from saving?
- What runs after save?
- Where is this custom logic inserted into delivered processing?
- What downstream integrations or batch processes can be triggered?

---

# Current Focus

## ✅ Phase 5 — Complete (as of 2026-07-01)

Phase 5 Knowledge Graph coverage is complete. 23 new providers were added across multiple sessions. All viable tables have been implemented; all unimplementable tables are documented in the Deprioritized Providers table above with reasons.

**IB Schema Definitions** (PSIBSCMADATA / PSIBSCMADFN) was the last candidate. Investigated 2026-07-01: no SELECT grant exists in HCM; PSIBSCMADATA stores raw XML as CLOB chunks — not browsable even with grants; PSIBSCMADFN header is redundant with existing PSMSGDEFN coverage. Deprioritized.

**Provider methodology for future sessions:**
1. Query `all_tab_columns` to find the real table and column names — never assume PeopleTools naming
2. Pull live sample rows to confirm usable keys and human-readable content
3. Write psdb.py → ptmetadata.py → graphdb.py → uom.py → routers/peoplesoft.py → routers/admin/<group>.py in order
4. Compile-check and smoke-test at each layer before proceeding
5. Document deprioritization reasons when tables are unimplementable

## ✅ Phase 7 — AI Engineering Assistant (Complete as of 2026-07-01)

3-provider AI assistant (Claude / OpenAI / Ollama) with 12+ tool definitions backed by live connectors.
Streaming chat at `/admin/assistant`; agentic tool loop up to 8 rounds; collapsible tool-call blocks.
Tools: `search_objects`, `peoplecode_search`, `graph_dependencies`, `graph_impact`, `who_has_access`,
`ae_steps`, `sql_lookup`, `envcompare_summary`, `project_impact`, `active_sessions`, `record_usage`,
`log_search`, `log_errors`, `session_log_chain`, `environment_health`, `ib_diagnostics`, `process_scheduler_health`.

## ✅ Phase 8 — Log Intelligence (Complete as of 2026-07-02)

Full log ingestion pipeline: PIA access/error, APPSRV, Tuxedo, nginx/Apache, F5, IGW errorLog.html, PRCS AE AESRV logs.
SSH/SFTP fetch with byte-offset tracking; 60s ingest cycle; SQLite `data/logs.db`.
Admin pages: `/admin/logs`, `/admin/log_errors`, `/admin/log_viewer`, `/admin/log_session`, `/admin/igw`, `/admin/prcs-ae`.
AI tools for log diagnosis; session chain correlation web→app; error surface with Ask AI deep-links.

**Remaining:** Process Scheduler log ingestion for Windows-hosted schedulers (SMB/WinRM transport) — blocked until a Windows scheduler server is available.

## ✅ What Changed Expansion + Security Audit (2026-07-02)

- **What Changed** expanded from 9 → 20 object types: Records, Components, Pages, AE Programs, Fields, PeopleCode, SQL Defs, Perm Lists, Roles (original 9) + Menus (PSMENUDEFN), Queries (PSQRYDEFN), Projects (PSPROJECTDEFN.descrlong), Processes (PS_PRCSDEFN), App Packages (PSPACKAGEDEFN), IB Messages (PSMSGDEFN), IB Routings (PSIBRTNGDEFN, filtered ~GENERATED~), Trees (PSTREEDEFN.tree_name), Translate Values (PSXLATITEM GROUP BY fieldname), Component Interfaces (PSBCDEFN)
- **OPRID filter** added to What Changed toolbar — client-side filter on the `op` column shows N/Total counts per type pill when active; empty filter string shows all results; filter applies immediately on input without re-querying
- **Security Audit Dashboard** at `/admin/secaudit`: stat cards (total operators/roles/PLs/active-30d), top roles by member count, top operators by role count, recent sign-ons (30d), orphaned roles panel, operator type breakdown; all via POST /api/sqlws/execute
- **Security nav group** consolidates secaudit/security/operator/role/permissionlist; permissionlist moved from Objects
- **SQR cross-reference in Record Explorer** — record UOM calls sqrdb.get_programs_for_table(table_name); "SQR Programs" section with _links.admin → /admin/sqr/{filename}; re-index triggered 2026-07-03 — 344 rows, 123 distinct tables

## ✅ Phase 10 — SQR Explorer (Partial, complete as of 2026-07-02)

SQR/SQC source artifact intelligence is live for FSCM (507 SQR + 698 SQC = 1,205 files indexed).
Admin pages: `/admin/sqr`, `/admin/sqr/{filename}`, `/admin/sqr/table/{table}`, `/admin/sqr/analytics`.
KG edges: `sqr_program → record` READS/WRITES, `sqr_program → sqr_program` INCLUDES, `prcs_defn → sqr_program` WRAPS.
Runtime process panel: SQR Report/Process type links directly to source.

**Remaining:** COBOL Explorer, COPYBOOK Explorer, SQR override intelligence, environment side-by-side comparison.

## Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence (Substantially Complete as of 2026-07-01)

Continuous drift detection, environment history, and impact forecasting are complete.

**Remaining:** Promotion history tracking (DEV → TEST → UAT → PROD) — needs real promotion-chain DB connections before implementation.

**What was delivered:**
- 16-type envcompare coverage (records, fields, components, pages, permissions, roles, AE, PeopleCode, SQL defs, portals, queries, menus, trees, IB routings, IB messages, comp. interfaces)
- AE step-level body comparison with unified SQL diff
- Scheduled drift snapshots (SQLite) with threshold + growth alerts, history time series
- KG-independent deployment risk scoring (weighted by object type) via `/api/impact/risk`
- Project impact reports via KG reverse traversal via `/api/impact/project`
- Admin pages: `/admin/drift`, `/admin/impact`
