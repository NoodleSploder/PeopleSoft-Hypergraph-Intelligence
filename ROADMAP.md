### ⚠️ Stub Providers (no live backing tables found in verified HCM schema)

Live schema verification (2026-06-30) found no SYSADM tables for these features.
All four are gracefully guarded by `has_table()` in psdb.py/graphdb.py and return empty/error results without crashing.
Marked `"stub": True` in OBJECT_REGISTRY. Table-name candidates in ptmetadata.py preserved for future investigation on other environments.

- Navigation Collections — `PTNC_COLLECTION` does not exist (PSPTPNCOLL is Push Notification Collections, 3 rows, unrelated feature)
- Event Mappings — `PSEFMAPPINGDEFN` does not exist
- Related Content — `PSRELCONDEFN` does not exist
- Drop Zones — `PSPTDZDEFN` does not exist

### ⛔ Deprioritized Providers

Investigated and deprioritized as of 2026-07-01. All are guarded by `has_table()` returns empty/stub results without crashing. Documented here for future re-evaluation on different environments or PeopleTools versions.

| Provider | Tables | Reason deprioritized |
|---|---|---|
| IB Schema Definitions | PSIBSCMADATA / PSIBSCMADFN | PSIBSCMADATA stores raw XML as CLOB chunks — not browsable; PSIBSCMADFN visible in `all_objects` but no SELECT grant in HCM; PSMSGDEFN already covers message structure |
| Navigation Collections | PTNC_COLLECTION | Does not exist in HCM; PSPTPNCOLL is Push Notification Collections (unrelated) |
| Event Mappings | PSEFMAPPINGDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| Related Content | PSRELCONDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| Drop Zones | PSPTDZDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| WorkCenters | — | No standalone definition header table; EOWC tables are runtime config keyed by portal object name |
| Dashboards | PS_EOEN_DASHBRD | 0 rows in HCM |
| BI Publisher / Branding / Page Composer | — | No backing definition tables in HCM SYSADM schema |
| Fluid Homepage / Tile Definitions | PSPGEDEFN / PSFLPGCOLLECT / PSHPDEFN / PSTILEDEFN | All absent or 0 rows in HCM |
| Activity Guide Collections | PS_AGC_TILE_TBL | 2 rows — too few to be useful |
| File Reference Definitions | PSFILEREDEFN | 19,622 rows but mostly system graphics/script refs with no descriptions; marginal value |
| Business Process Definitions | PSBUSPROCDEFN | 133 rows of legacy Workflow Navigator definitions from 2000–2002; deprecated framework |
| IB Local Schema | PSLSDEFN | 319 rows of XML schema stored as compressed binary data; display impractical |
| IB Service Setup | PSIBSVCSETUP | Single-row global IB gateway config; not a browsable catalog |

## Relationship Expansion

Continue enriching graph relationships.

### ✅ Completed

- Shared UOM relationship graph helper introduced; all in-module UOM object graph previews now use it, including Field, Record, Component, Page, Portal Registry, Operator, Role, Permission List, IB Service Operation, IB Node, IB Queue, IB Routing, SQL Definition, Tree, Component Interface, and other compact UOM previews
- Generic `/api/peoplesoft/graph/{type}/{name}` now resolves canonical object types through UOM first, so Graph Explorer compact graph previews align with Object Explorer for Record, Operator, Role, Permission List, Component, Page, Portal Registry, IB Node/Queue/Routing, Tree, CI, SQL Definition, and future UOM-backed providers
- PeopleCode and Application Engine domain graph endpoints now declare `_source`, `_vocabulary`, and `_semantics` and expose Knowledge Graph-compatible edge `type` aliases while preserving existing `relationship` labels
- Page graph API unified with UOM Page provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- Component graph API unified with UOM Component provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- CALLS, REFERENCES, USES, CONTAINS, WRAPS, SECURES edge types in active use
- Component security graph edges through Permission Lists → Roles → Operators
- Menu → Component CONTAINS edges
- CI → Component WRAPS edges
- Application Engine → Process Definition GENERATES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion
- Application Engine SQL step READS/WRITES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion, with AE section/step metadata
- SQL Definition body READS/WRITES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion, using PSSQLTEXTDEFN text where grants allow
- PeopleCode literal SQL READS/WRITES edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion for direct `SQLExec("...")` and `CreateSQL("...")` calls
- Project → object DEPLOYS edges in persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion for safely mapped PSPROJECTITEM object types
- Project UOM object pages and compact graph previews expose the same Project → object DEPLOYS relationship model
- Persisted Knowledge Graph payloads now advertise `_source`, `_vocabulary`, and `_semantics`, and normalize edge `relationship` aliases to match UOM/domain graph contracts
- PS Query UOM objects now expose records/output fields as `_relationships` and compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Query → Record `USES`, Query → Field `EXPOSES`, and Record → Field `CONTAINS` edges for public queries
- Menu UOM compact graph previews now use the shared relationship graph helper and align Menu → Component `CONTAINS` edges with persisted Knowledge Graph semantics
- Application Package UOM objects now expose classes/PeopleCode relationships and compact graph previews; persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits Application Package → App Class `CONTAINS` edges
- Application Package PeopleCode relationships now use real PSPCMPROG `PROGSEQ` identities and persisted Knowledge Graph ingestion emits App Class → PeopleCode `CONTAINS` edges
- Standalone App Class UOM objects now expose package/PeopleCode relationships and compact graph previews with App Class → Package `BELONGS_TO` and App Class → PeopleCode `CONTAINS` edges
- Tree → Record USES edges
- Impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal with depth control)

### Remaining

- Continue aligning provider-specific Knowledge Graph ingestion with UOM `_relationships` / `_graph` relationship definitions
- Broader READS/WRITES coverage for non-literal PeopleCode dynamic SQL

---

## Cross References

Every object should answer:

### ✅ Completed

- What references me? (implemented for AE SQL steps via `%SQL()`, PeopleCode source references, SQL cross-references)
- What do I reference? (implemented for Components, Pages, Records, AE programs, Portal Registry)
- Who secures me? (implemented for Components, Pages, Permission Lists, Portal Registry with access-path visualization)
- What breaks if I change? (impact analysis via Knowledge Graph traversal)
- Child records, subrecord derivations, and AE state records for Record objects

### Remaining

- Universal "what references me / what do I reference" coverage across all object types
- "Who executes me?" for runtime-linked objects (AEs, Service Operations)
- Consistent cross-reference sections in every UOM provider

---

# Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence

## Continuous Drift Detection

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph drift: compares current live graph against most-recent snapshot; surfaces new, removed, and changed nodes by type in the Graph Explorer DRIFT tab

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Knowledge Graph drift: compares current live graph against most-recent snapshot; surfaces new, removed, and changed nodes by type in the Graph Explorer DRIFT tab
- Menu comparison (`/api/envcompare/menus`) — diffs PSMENUDEFN (637 rows) including menutype, description, owner, timestamp
- Tree comparison (`/api/envcompare/trees`) — diffs PSTREEDEFN (326 rows), latest effective row per tree; shows status, description, timestamp
- IB Routing comparison (`/api/envcompare/ib_routings`) — diffs PSIBRTNGDEFN named routings (auto-generated excluded); shows type, operation, sender/receiver nodes
- IB Message comparison (`/api/envcompare/ib_messages`) — diffs PSMSGDEFN (4272 rows); shows status, description, owner
- Component Interface comparison (`/api/envcompare/ci`) — diffs PSBCDEFN; shows type, description, backing component (added 2026-07-01)
- AE step/body comparison (`/api/envcompare/ae-body`) — step-level diff; SQL text via PSAESTMTDEFN/PSSQLTEXTDEFN; unified diff per changed step (added 2026-07-01)
- Summary sidebar updated with Menus, Trees, IB Routings, IB Messages, Comp. Interfaces counts
- Environment Compare UI updated with 5 new tabs (Menus, Trees, IB Routings, IB Messages, Comp. Interfaces) + AE body drill-down within AE tab

### Remaining

Automatically detect changes in:

- PeopleCode (changed programs between environments) — ✅ already done (`/api/envcompare/peoplecode` + deep source diff)
- SQL definitions — ✅ already done (`/api/envcompare/sql_definitions`)
- Security (changed permission lists, roles) — ✅ already done (`/api/envcompare/permissions`, `/api/envcompare/roles`)
- Menus — ✅ added 2026-07-01
- Trees — ✅ added 2026-07-01
- Integration Broker metadata — ✅ added 2026-07-01 (routings + messages)

- Component interface comparison (`/api/envcompare/ci`) — diffs PSBCDEFN; shows type, description, backing component — ✅ added 2026-07-01
- AE program body comparison (`/api/envcompare/ae-body`) — step-level diff of PSAESTEPDEFN + SQL text from PSAESTMTDEFN/PSSQLTEXTDEFN; unified diff per changed step — ✅ added 2026-07-01

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Scheduled drift reports: `driftdb.py` SQLite store + scheduler daemon integration — runs envcompare summary after each graph snapshot cycle, persists point-in-time counts, auto-generates threshold alerts (|delta| ≥ 50) and growth-rate alerts (delta grows >10%), auto-resolves when drift subsides
- `/api/drift/snapshot` (POST) — manual trigger
- `/api/drift/latest`, `/api/drift/history`, `/api/drift/alerts` (GET)
- `/admin/drift` — drift history UI with sparklines, alert table, and Snapshot Now button

---

## Environment History

Maintain historical snapshots.

### ✅ Completed

- Environment comparison across HCM and FSCM for Records, Fields, PeopleCode, SQL Definitions, PS Queries, Portals, and Knowledge Graph
- Portal object deep comparison (definition diff, children diff, permissions diff)
- Operator comparison (roles, permission lists, component access diff between two OPRIDs)

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Point-in-time runtime snapshots: every drift cycle stores a full count snapshot in `drift.db` (16 object types per environment pair, timestamped)
- Temporal history of security and metadata changes: drift history API returns per-type time series; Drift History admin page visualizes trends with delta sparklines

### ✅ Completed (Phase 1 — 2026-07-01)

- Promotion event log: `connectors/promotiondb.py` SQLite store + `routers/promotions.py` REST API
  - `POST /api/promotions` — record an event (pillar, project, from_env, to_env, date, by, notes, ticket_ref)
  - `GET /api/promotions` — list events with pillar/project/env filters
  - `GET /api/promotions/timeline` — chronological view for a single project
  - `GET /api/promotions/summary` — per-project latest promotion summary for a pillar
  - `DELETE /api/promotions/{id}` — remove a record
  - `/admin/promotions` — log form + filterable timeline table; env suggestions (DV/TST/UAT/CRP/PAR/PER/PRD)
  - Phase 1 note displayed in UI; "Promotions" added to Runtime nav group

### Remaining (Phase 2 — Future)

- **Auto-detection from PSPROJECTDEFN**: when DV/TST/UAT/PRD Oracle DB connections are added to
  `config.json`, snapshot `PSPROJECTDEFN.LASTUPDDTTM` per environment, detect when a project's
  timestamp in the target env advances to match the source env — automatically record a promotion event.
  The Phase 1 SQLite schema and API are already designed to accommodate this without structural changes.
- **Lab context**: this system is a development lab. Promotion-chain environments (DV/TST/UAT/PRD)
  do not exist yet. HCM and FSCM are separate application pillars and are NOT in a promotion chain
  with each other. Phase 2 implementation begins when real promotion-chain DB connections are available.

---

## Impact Forecasting

Predict downstream impact before migration.

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal, upstream/downstream node enumeration by type)
- AE restart eligibility analysis

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Pre-migration impact reports: `/admin/impact` — full project impact report with KG traversal, affected node breakdown by type, and per-object downstream count; warns when KG coverage is insufficient
- Deployment risk scoring: `/api/impact/risk` — KG-independent risk assessment using drift snapshot data; weights object types by risk (security=5×, PeopleCode/IB=4×, AE/SQL=3×, others=1×); returns per-type drift level (Minor/Moderate/Significant/Major) and overall risk label (Low/Medium/High/Critical); auto-loads on `/admin/impact` page open

---

# Phase 7 — AI Engineering Assistant

Leverage the knowledge graph and source search for natural-language engineering assistance.
Answer questions like "Where is employee termination implemented?", "Which AEs update PS_JOB?",
"Who has access to this component?", or "Show me the SQL definitions that touch COMPENSATION."

---

## Architecture (decided 2026-07-01)

### Provider Abstraction

All AI communication goes through a single abstract interface in `connectors/ai.py`.
Provider-specific implementations live in separate modules. Nothing above the connector
layer touches provider-specific code.

```
connectors/ai.py          ← get_provider() factory + AIProvider ABC
connectors/ai_claude.py   ← Anthropic SDK, native tool_use blocks
connectors/ai_openai.py   ← OpenAI SDK, function calling
connectors/ai_ollama.py   ← Ollama local REST API (no external key required)
connectors/ai_tools.py    ← Tool definitions wrapping existing PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence connectors
```

**Design decision:** All three providers ship at launch. Ollama enables air-gap / lab use
with no external API key. The factory pattern means adding a fourth provider later requires
only a new `ai_<name>.py` file and a config entry.

### Config Shape (`config.json`)

```json
"ai": {
  "provider": "claude",
  "claude":  { "api_key": "sk-ant-...", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6" },
  "openai":  { "api_key": "sk-...",     "model": "gpt-4o" },
  "ollama":  { "base_url": "http://localhost:11434", "model": "llama3.1" }
}
```

Only the active provider's section is used at runtime. API keys may also be supplied via
environment variables (`CLAUDE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`) — env vars
take precedence over config.json values when both are present.

**Design decision:** `config.json` is the primary source (consistent with DB credentials).
Environment variable override is available for CI/container deployments.

### Tools (AI-callable PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence capabilities)

Each tool is a thin adapter over an existing connector function — no new SQL.

| Tool | Backs |
|------|-------|
| `search_objects` | `ptmetadata` global search |
| `peoplecode_search` | `peoplecode.source_search()` |
| `graph_dependencies` | `graphdb.dependency_tree()` forward |
| `graph_impact` | `graphdb.dependency_tree()` reverse |
| `who_has_access` | permlist/role/component security connectors |
| `ae_steps` | `ae.ae_steps()` |
| `sql_lookup` | `sqlws` read-only query execution |
| `envcompare_summary` | `envcompare.summary()` |
| `project_impact` | `impact.project_impact()` |

### UI — `/admin/assistant`

- Streaming chat window (SSE or chunked response)
- Provider/model badge showing active configuration
- Tool calls shown as collapsible "thinking" blocks (what was queried, what came back)
- Conversation history held in session (not persisted to disk)
- Example prompts for first-time users

---

## Natural Language Search Examples

- Where is employee termination implemented?
- Show every SQL touching PS_JOB.
- Which AEs update JOB?
- Which Components use this record?
- Who has access to the Benefits Administration component?
- What PeopleCode fires on save for PERSONAL_DATA?
- Compare security between HCM and FSCM.

---

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Architecture design and provider abstraction pattern
- Tool inventory defined (backed by existing connectors)
- Config schema defined

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- `connectors/ai.py` — `AIProvider` ABC with `chat()`, `format_tool_call_turn()`, `format_tool_results_turn()` abstract methods; `get_provider()` factory; `provider_status()` (no secrets exposed)
- `connectors/ai_claude.py` — Anthropic SDK; native tool_use content blocks; Anthropic message history format
- `connectors/ai_openai.py` — OpenAI SDK; function calling; OpenAI message history format
- `connectors/ai_ollama.py` — Ollama local REST (`/api/chat`); OpenAI-compatible tool format; no external key required
- `connectors/ai_tools.py` — 9 tool definitions + dispatch: `search_objects`, `peoplecode_search`, `graph_dependencies`, `graph_impact`, `who_has_access`, `ae_steps`, `sql_lookup`, `envcompare_summary`, `project_impact`
- `routers/assistant.py` — `POST /api/assistant/chat` (blocking + SSE streaming); agentic loop up to 8 tool rounds; `GET /api/assistant/status`
- `/admin/assistant` — Chat UI: example prompts sidebar, provider/model badge, collapsible tool-call blocks, auto-resize textarea, Enter to send
- Provider message format isolation: each provider implements its own `format_tool_call_turn()` / `format_tool_results_turn()` so the router stays provider-agnostic
- `anthropic` and `openai` packages installed in venv
- `config.json["ai"]` section with provider selection + per-provider config; env var overrides (`CLAUDE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`)
- Tested end-to-end with OpenAI GPT-4o: `search_objects` tool called, 20 records returned, synthesized answer ✓

# Phase 8 — Log Intelligence

Ingest, store, query, and AI-analyze web server and application server logs from all
PeopleSoft infrastructure tiers. Surface errors with drill-down to responsible objects
and users, and guide engineers to a fix.

---

## Architecture (decided 2026-07-01)

### Infrastructure Tiers

PeopleSoft log sources covered:

| Tier | Log type | Parser | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| F5 LTM load balancer | `f5_access` | Apache combined | HSL iRule output |
| nginx / Apache reverse proxy | `apache_access` / `apache_error` | Apache combined | Standard NCSA format |
| WebLogic PIA (web) | `pia_access` / `pia_error` | PIA NCSA extended | OPRID in auth field |
| Tuxedo App Server | `appsrv` | APPSRV format | OPRID, ORA-, PC errors |
| Tuxedo ULOG | `tuxedo` | ULOG format | Domain-level events |

### SSH Log Fetching

All log sources are remote — fetched via SSH/SFTP using paramiko.
- `ssh_hosts` in `config.json` defines reusable connection profiles (host, port, user, key or password)
- Each log source references an `ssh_host` alias
- File byte-offset tracking: only new content is fetched per cycle (no re-reading)
- Connection pool per host; auto-reconnect on failure
- Sources with `ssh_host: "local"` read files directly without SSH

### Config Shape

```json
"ssh_hosts": {
  "webserver1": { "host": "10.0.0.10", "port": 22, "username": "psadm1", "key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa" },
  "appserver1": { "host": "10.0.0.11", "port": 22, "username": "psadm1", "key_path": "~/.ssh/id_rsa" }
},
"log_sources": [
  { "name": "WEB1_ACCESS", "type": "pia_access",   "env": "HCM", "ssh_host": "webserver1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/servers/PIA/logs/PIA_access*.log", "enabled": true },

```

### Storage — SQLite `data/logs.db`

```
log_sources    — source registry with last-ingest offset tracking (JSON per file)
web_entries    — parsed access log rows (oprid, component, page, status, ms, ts)
app_entries    — parsed APPSRV/ULOG rows (oprid, level, message, object_ref, ts)
log_errors     — extracted errors deduped by (source, ts, raw)
```

Indices on `ts`, `oprid`, `status`, `error_code`, `object_ref` for fast filtering.

### Session Chain Correlation

```
PSACCESSLOG (OPRID=GUACUSER, ts=10:22)
   ↓
web_entries WHERE oprid='GUACUSER' AND ts ∈ [login-15min, login+4h]
   ↓ component/page extracted from URL pattern /psp/{site}/{portal}/{node}/c/{menu}.{component}.{page}.GBL
app_entries WHERE oprid='GUACUSER' AND ts in same window
   ↓ ORA-, PeopleCode errors → extract table/component/AE names
log_errors  WHERE oprid='GUACUSER' → cross-ref with PS metadata
```

### Error Drill-Down

1. **Surface**: `/admin/log_errors` — grouped by error_code + object_ref, top-N by count
2. **Who**: which OPRIDs triggered the error, first/last seen
3. **What object**: record/component/AE name extracted from error message → links to PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence pages
4. **Fix**: "Ask AI" pre-loads the assistant with the error context; AI uses existing tools
   (`peoplecode_search`, `record_usage`, `sql_lookup`) to diagnose and suggest a fix

### AI Tools Added

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `log_search` | Search web+app entries by OPRID, time range, component, text, level |
| `log_errors` | Surface and group errors; returns error_code, object_ref, count, sample |
| `session_log_chain` | Full web→app chain for an OPRID in a time window |

### Integration Gateway Log Consumption

PeopleSoft Integration Gateway writes gateway-specific diagnostic logs that must be consumed independently from standard PIA/WebLogic logs.

Additional log sources:

| Tier | Log type | Parser | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Integration Gateway | `igw_msg_log` | IGW HTML log parser | `msgLog.html`; gateway message activity, routing, service operation details |
| Integration Gateway | `igw_error_log` | IGW HTML log parser | `errorLog.html`; gateway exceptions, target connector failures, authentication failures, routing errors |

### Config Shape — Integration Gateway Logs

Integration Gateway logs are configured independently in `config.json`, allowing each web server to define its own gateway log paths.

```json
"igw_log_sources": [
  {
    "name": "HCM_WEB1_IGW_MSG",
    "type": "igw_msg_log",
    "env": "HCM",
    "ssh_host": "hcm_web1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/applications/peoplesoft/PSIGW/msgLog.html",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "name": "HCM_WEB1_IGW_ERROR",
    "type": "igw_error_log",
    "env": "HCM",
    "ssh_host": "hcm_web1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/pt/webserv/HCM/applications/peoplesoft/PSIGW/errorLog.html",
    "enabled": true
  }
]

### Process Scheduler Transport Support

Process Scheduler log retrieval must support both Unix/Linux and Windows-hosted scheduler servers.

Unlike app server and web server log ingestion, Process Scheduler domains may run on:

- Linux / Unix
- Windows Server
- mixed platform deployments

Therefore `prcs_log_sources` must allow an explicit retrieval method per source.

Supported transport types:

| Transport | Use case |
|----------|----------|
| `local` | Same-host file reads |
| `ssh_sftp` | Linux/Unix Process Scheduler servers |
| `smb` | Windows Process Scheduler servers via file share |
| `winrm` | Windows Process Scheduler servers via remote command/file retrieval |
| `agent` | Future lightweight PHI collector agent installed on scheduler host |

### Updated Config Shape — Process Scheduler Logs

```json
"prcs_log_sources": [
  {
    "name": "HCM_PRCS_LINUX_DOMAIN",
    "type": "prcs_scheduler",
    "env": "HCM",
    "platform": "linux",
    "transport": "ssh_sftp",
    "ssh_host": "hcm_prcs_linux1",
    "path": "/opt/oracle/psft/cfg/appserv/prcs/HCM/LOGS/*.LOG",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "name": "HCM_PRCS_WINDOWS_OUTPUT",
    "type": "prcs_process_log",
    "env": "HCM",
    "platform": "windows",
    "transport": "smb",
    "smb_host": "hcm-prcs-win1",
    "share": "PS_CFG_HOME",
    "path": "appserv\\prcs\\HCM\\files\\log_output\\*\\*\\*.log",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "name": "HCM_PRCS_WINDOWS_TRACE",
    "type": "prcs_trace",
    "env": "HCM",
    "platform": "windows",
    "transport": "winrm",
    "winrm_host": "hcm-prcs-win1",
    "path": "C:\\psft\\pt\\8.61\\appserv\\prcs\\HCM\\files\\log_output\\*\\*\\*.tracesql",
    "enabled": false
  }
]

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Architecture design and config schema
- `connectors/sshclient.py` — paramiko SSH/SFTP wrapper with connection pooling and byte-offset tracking
- `connectors/logparser.py` — PIA access/error/servlet/weblogic/stdout, APPSRV, Tuxedo ULOG, Apache/nginx, F5 parsers; PS-specific error code extraction (ORA-XXXXX, HTTP_NNN, IB_PCODEWOL, IB_EXT_APP, AUTH_FAIL, WEBPROFILE_ERR); object reference extraction; OPRID extraction from message body
- `connectors/logdb.py` — SQLite storage with web_entries/app_entries/log_errors tables; `re_extract_errors()` backfill for improved extraction patterns
- `connectors/logingest.py` — ingestion orchestration with per-file byte-offset tracking
- `connectors/scheduler.py` — 60s log ingest job integrated with graph snapshot scheduler
- `routers/logs.py` — REST API: sources, web, app, errors (with summary grouping), session chain, search, ingest trigger, re-extract trigger
- `routers/admin/logs.py` — `/admin/logs` (source overview), `/admin/log_errors` (grouped error surface with Ask AI), `/admin/log_viewer` (filtered web/app/error browser), `/admin/log_session` (OPRID session chain)
- AI tools: `log_search`, `log_errors`, `session_log_chain` in `connectors/ai_tools.py`
- 7+ active log sources ingesting live HCM data; error surface groups errors by code+object (HTTP_502, IB_PCODEWOL, WEBPROFILE_ERR, AUTH_FAIL, IB_EXT_APP)

### Design Decisions

- **F5**: Supported via `f5_access` type using Apache-combined parser (HSL iRules log in NCSA format)
- **Future F5 native**: When F5 Analytics/AVR logs become available, add `f5_avr` parser with VS name, pool, irule fields
- **Retention**: 30 days of web entries, 90 days of app entries, 90 days of errors (configurable)
- **Dedup**: log_errors has UNIQUE(source_name, ts, raw) — safe to re-ingest overlapping byte ranges
- **OPRID extraction**: web logs — second NCSA field (auth user); app logs — context field + message body fallback

# Current Focus

## ✅ Phase 5 — Complete (as of 2026-07-01)

Phase 5 Knowledge Graph coverage is complete. 23 new providers were added across multiple sessions. All viable tables have been implemented; all unimplementable tables are documented in the Deprioritized Providers table above with reasons.

**IB Schema Definitions** (PSIBSCMADATA / PSIBSCMADFN) was the last candidate. Investigated 2026-07-01: no SELECT grant exists in HCM; PSIBSCMADATA stores raw XML as CLOB chunks — not browsable even with grants; PSIBSCMADFN header is redundant with existing PSMSGDEFN coverage. Deprioritized.

**Provider methodology for future sessions:**
1. Query `all_tab_columns` to find the real table and column names — never assume PeopleTools naming
2. Pull live sample rows to confirm usable keys and human-readable content
3. Write psdb.py → ptmetadata.py → graphdb.py → uom.py → routers/peoplesoft.py → routers/admin/<group>.py in order
4. Compile-check and smoke-test at each layer before proceeding
5. Document deprioritization reasons when tables are unimplementable

## Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence (Substantially Complete as of 2026-07-01)

Continuous drift detection, environment history, and impact forecasting are complete.

**Remaining:** Promotion history tracking (DEV → TEST → UAT → PROD) — needs design before implementation.

**What was delivered:**
- 16-type envcompare coverage (records, fields, components, pages, permissions, roles, AE, PeopleCode, SQL defs, portals, queries, menus, trees, IB routings, IB messages, comp. interfaces)
- AE step-level body comparison with unified SQL diff
- Scheduled drift snapshots (SQLite) with threshold + growth alerts, history time series
- KG-independent deployment risk scoring (weighted by object type) via `/api/impact/risk`
- Project impact reports via KG reverse traversal via `/api/impact/project`
- Admin pages: `/admin/drift`, `/admin/impact`
