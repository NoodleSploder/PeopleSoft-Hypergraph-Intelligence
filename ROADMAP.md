## Relationship Expansion

Continue enriching graph relationships.

### ✅ Completed

- Shared UOM relationship graph helper introduced; Tree, Component Interface, and Page providers use it

- CALLS, REFERENCES, USES, CONTAINS, WRAPS, SECURES edge types in active use
- Component security graph edges through Permission Lists → Roles → Operators
- Menu → Component CONTAINS edges
- CI → Component WRAPS edges
- Tree → Record USES edges
- Impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal with depth control)

### Remaining

- Continue migrating mature UOM providers from ad hoc graph loops to declarative relationship specs
- Align UOM `_relationships`, UOM `_graph`, and Knowledge Graph ingestion around one relationship vocabulary
- GENERATES and DEPLOYS edge types
- Full relationship coverage examples: WRITES, READS

---

## Cross References

Every object should answer:

### ✅ Completed

- What references me? (implemented for AE SQL steps via `%SQL()`, PeopleCode source references, SQL cross-references)
- What do I reference? (implemented for Components, Pages, Records, AE programs, Portal Registry)
- Who secures me? (implemented for Components, Pages, Permission Lists, Portal Registry with access-path visualization)
- What breaks if I change? (impact analysis via Knowledge Graph traversal)
- Child records, subrecord derivations, and AE state records for Record objects

### Remaining

- Universal "what references me / what do I reference" coverage across all object types

- Consistent cross-reference sections in every UOM provider

---

# Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence

# Next Slice

The following providers are ready to implement in the next session cycle.

## Phase 5 — Immediate Next Providers

- **Search Categories** (`PTSF_SRCAT`) — categories grouping search definitions; two-panel explorer with association to parent definition
- **Drop Zones** (`PTDROPZONE`) — upgrade from planned stub to full provider with registry entry, UOM, REST endpoint, and explorer page
- **WorkCenters** — PeopleSoft WorkCenter definitions; search and detail view
