### ⚠️ Stub Providers (no live backing tables found in verified HCM schema)

Live schema verification (2026-06-30) found no SYSADM tables for these features.
All four are gracefully guarded by `has_table()` in psdb.py/graphdb.py and return empty/error results without crashing.
Marked `"stub": True` in OBJECT_REGISTRY. Table-name candidates in ptmetadata.py preserved for future investigation on other environments.

- Navigation Collections — `PTNC_COLLECTION` does not exist (PSPTPNCOLL is Push Notification Collections, 3 rows, unrelated feature)
- Event Mappings — `PSEFMAPPINGDEFN` does not exist
- Related Content — `PSRELCONDEFN` does not exist
- Drop Zones — `PSPTDZDEFN` does not exist

### Remaining Providers

- BI Publisher report definitions
- WorkCenters
- Dashboards
- Homepage Tiles
- Branding
- Page Composer

---

## Relationship Expansion

Continue enriching graph relationships.

### ✅ Completed

- Shared UOM relationship graph helper introduced; Tree, Component Interface, Page, Component, Record, Operator, Role, and Permission List providers use it
- Page graph API unified with UOM Page provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- Component graph API unified with UOM Component provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- CALLS, REFERENCES, USES, CONTAINS, WRAPS, SECURES edge types in active use
- Component security graph edges through Permission Lists → Roles → Operators
- Menu → Component CONTAINS edges
- CI → Component WRAPS edges
- Tree → Record USES edges
- Impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal with depth control)

### Remaining

- Continue migrating mature UOM providers from ad hoc graph loops to declarative relationship specs
- Align UOM `_relationships`, UOM `_graph`, and Knowledge Graph ingestion around one relationship vocabulary
- GENERATES and DEPLOYS edge types
- Full relationship coverage examples: WRITES, READS

---

## Cross References

Every object should answer:

### ✅ Completed

- What references me? (implemented for AE SQL steps via `%SQL()`, PeopleCode source references, SQL cross-references)
- What do I reference? (implemented for Components, Pages, Records, AE programs, Portal Registry)
- Who secures me? (implemented for Components, Pages, Permission Lists, Portal Registry with access-path visualization)
- What breaks if I change? (impact analysis via Knowledge Graph traversal)
- Child records, subrecord derivations, and AE state records for Record objects

### Remaining

- Universal "what references me / what do I reference" coverage across all object types
- "Who executes me?" for runtime-linked objects (AEs, Service Operations)
- Consistent cross-reference sections in every UOM provider

---

# Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence

## Continuous Drift Detection

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph drift: compares current live graph against most-recent snapshot; surfaces new, removed, and changed nodes by type in the Graph Explorer DRIFT tab

### Remaining

Automatically detect changes in:

- PeopleCode (changed programs between environments)
- SQL definitions
- Security (changed permission lists, roles)
- Menus
- Trees

- Temporal history of security and metadata changes

---

## Impact Forecasting

Predict downstream impact before migration.

### ✅ Completed

---

# Next Slice

## Session 2026-06-30 Completed

All existing providers have been rewritten against the verified live SYSADM schema:
- Approval Framework, XML Publisher, Search Definitions, Search Categories: fully rewritten and live-verified end-to-end
- Navigation Collections, Event Mappings, Related Content, Drop Zones: confirmed as stubs (no backing tables in HCM); gracefully handled via `has_table()` guards; marked `"stub": True` in OBJECT_REGISTRY

## Phase 5 — Next Providers to Implement

New providers should follow the established verification methodology:
1. Query `all_tables`/`all_tab_columns` to find the real table and column names
2. Pull live sample rows to confirm usable keys (never assume PeopleTools naming conventions)
3. Write psdb.py → ptmetadata.py → graphdb.py → uom.py → routers/peoplesoft.py → routers/admin.py in that order
4. Compile-check and smoke-test at each layer before proceeding

Completed in this session:
- **PivotGrid Explorer** — implemented against verified `PSPGCORE` (154 rows); exposes data model columns, data source type (PS Query vs Component), query name, NUI options
- **Connected Query Explorer** — implemented against verified `PSCONQRSDEFN` (97 rows); shows parent-child query composition and field join relationships
- **Process Definition Explorer** — implemented against verified `PS_PRCSDEFN` (2873 rows); composite key PRCSTYPE~PRCSNAME; shows run control pages and process groups
- **File Layout Explorer** — implemented against verified `PSFLDDEFN` (533 rows); shows segments (PSFLDSEGDEFN) and fields (PSFLDFIELDDEFN); supports Fixed Width/Delimited/XML formats

Completed this session (2026-06-30 continued):
- **IB Application Services** — implemented against verified `PSIBAPPLDEFN` (13 apps); exposes REST endpoint operations via PSIBAPPMETHOD/PSIBAPPURI with HTTP methods and URI templates
- **Application Class Definitions** — implemented against verified `PSAPPCLASSDEFN` (12622 rows, 1860 packages); compound key PACKAGEROOT~QUALIFYPATH~APPCLASSID; shows full class path with sibling classes and sub-package tree
- **Content Service Provider Definitions** — implemented against verified `PSPTCSSRVDEFN` (1016 rows); powers Related Actions, WorkCenter actions, Fluid navigation; shows parameters and where-used portal objects
- **PeopleTools Test Framework (PTF) Tests** — implemented against verified `PSPTTSTDEFN` (161 rows); Script/Shell/Library types; shows test cases and up to 150 commands with page/field context

Candidates for next session:
Implemented in this session:
- ADS Definitions, IB Service Groups, URL Definitions, Chatbot Skills, IB Routings, Style Sheets, Data Archive Objects

Deprioritized (no backing tables or too few rows):
- **WorkCenters** — no standalone definition header table; EOWC tables are runtime config keyed by portal object name
- **Dashboards** — no definition tables (PS_EOEN_DASHBRD is 0 rows)
- **BI Publisher / Branding / Page Composer** — no backing definition tables in HCM SYSADM schema
- **Fluid Homepage / Tile Definitions** — all tile/homepage tables (PSPGEDEFN, PSFLPGCOLLECT, PSHPDEFN, PSTILEDEFN, PS_PTTILE_*) absent or 0 rows in HCM
- **Activity Guide Collections** — PS_AGC_TILE_TBL (2 rows): too few
- **File Reference Definitions** — PSFILEREDEFN (19622 rows): mostly system graphics/script refs, no descriptions, marginal value
- **Business Process Definitions** — PSBUSPROCDEFN (133 rows): legacy Workflow Navigator definitions from 2000-2002; deprecated framework
- **IB Local Schema** — PSLSDEFN (319 rows): XML schema stored as compressed binary data; display impractical
- **IB Service Setup** — PSIBSVCSETUP (1 row): single-row global IB gateway configuration; not a browsable catalog

Candidates for future sessions:
- **IB Schema Definitions** — PSIBSCMADATA/PSIBSCMADFN (3680/3618 rows): IB XML schema metadata; investigate if human-readable name + type columns exist for browsing

Completed (previous candidates now implemented):
- **Timezone Definitions** — PSTIMEZONEDEFN (61 rows) + PSTIMEZONEIANA (592 rows)
- **Locale Definitions** — PSLOCALEDEFN (191 rows) + PSLOCALEOPTNDFN (923 rows)
- **Performance Monitor Metrics** — PSPMMETRICDEFN (206 rows) + PSPMTRANSDEFN (74 rows) + PSPMEVENTDEFN (32 rows): metric/transaction/event catalog; reverse lookup shows which transactions and events reference each metric
