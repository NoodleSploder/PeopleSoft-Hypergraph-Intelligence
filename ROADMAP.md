### ⚠️ Stub Providers (no live backing tables found in verified HCM schema)

Live schema verification (2026-06-30) found no SYSADM tables for these features.
All four are gracefully guarded by `has_table()` in psdb.py/graphdb.py and return empty/error results without crashing.
Marked `"stub": True` in OBJECT_REGISTRY. Table-name candidates in ptmetadata.py preserved for future investigation on other environments.

- Navigation Collections — `PTNC_COLLECTION` does not exist (PSPTPNCOLL is Push Notification Collections, 3 rows, unrelated feature)
- Event Mappings — `PSEFMAPPINGDEFN` does not exist
- Related Content — `PSRELCONDEFN` does not exist
- Drop Zones — `PSPTDZDEFN` does not exist

### ⛔ Deprioritized Providers

Investigated and deprioritized as of 2026-07-01. All are guarded by `has_table()` returns empty/stub results without crashing. Documented here for future re-evaluation on different environments or PeopleTools versions.

| Provider | Tables | Reason deprioritized |
|---|---|---|
| IB Schema Definitions | PSIBSCMADATA / PSIBSCMADFN | PSIBSCMADATA stores raw XML as CLOB chunks — not browsable; PSIBSCMADFN visible in `all_objects` but no SELECT grant in HCM; PSMSGDEFN already covers message structure |
| Navigation Collections | PTNC_COLLECTION | Does not exist in HCM; PSPTPNCOLL is Push Notification Collections (unrelated) |
| Event Mappings | PSEFMAPPINGDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| Related Content | PSRELCONDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| Drop Zones | PSPTDZDEFN | Does not exist in HCM |
| WorkCenters | — | No standalone definition header table; EOWC tables are runtime config keyed by portal object name |
| Dashboards | PS_EOEN_DASHBRD | 0 rows in HCM |
| BI Publisher / Branding / Page Composer | — | No backing definition tables in HCM SYSADM schema |
| Fluid Homepage / Tile Definitions | PSPGEDEFN / PSFLPGCOLLECT / PSHPDEFN / PSTILEDEFN | All absent or 0 rows in HCM |
| Activity Guide Collections | PS_AGC_TILE_TBL | 2 rows — too few to be useful |
| File Reference Definitions | PSFILEREDEFN | 19,622 rows but mostly system graphics/script refs with no descriptions; marginal value |
| Business Process Definitions | PSBUSPROCDEFN | 133 rows of legacy Workflow Navigator definitions from 2000–2002; deprecated framework |
| IB Local Schema | PSLSDEFN | 319 rows of XML schema stored as compressed binary data; display impractical |
| IB Service Setup | PSIBSVCSETUP | Single-row global IB gateway config; not a browsable catalog |

## Relationship Expansion

Continue enriching graph relationships.

### ✅ Completed

- Shared UOM relationship graph helper introduced; all in-module UOM object graph previews now use it, including Field, Record, Component, Page, Portal Registry, Operator, Role, Permission List, IB Service Operation, IB Node, IB Queue, IB Routing, SQL Definition, Tree, Component Interface, and other compact UOM previews
- Page graph API unified with UOM Page provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- Component graph API unified with UOM Component provider so Object Explorer and Graph Explorer share the same relationship model
- CALLS, REFERENCES, USES, CONTAINS, WRAPS, SECURES edge types in active use
- Component security graph edges through Permission Lists → Roles → Operators
- Menu → Component CONTAINS edges
- CI → Component WRAPS edges
- Tree → Record USES edges
- Impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal with depth control)

### Remaining

- Reconcile route-specific `/api/peoplesoft/graph/{type}/{name}` endpoints that still intentionally differ from compact UOM graph previews
- Align UOM `_relationships`, UOM `_graph`, route-specific graph APIs, and Knowledge Graph ingestion around one relationship vocabulary
- GENERATES and DEPLOYS edge types
- Full relationship coverage examples: WRITES, READS

---

## Cross References

Every object should answer:

### ✅ Completed

- What references me? (implemented for AE SQL steps via `%SQL()`, PeopleCode source references, SQL cross-references)
- What do I reference? (implemented for Components, Pages, Records, AE programs, Portal Registry)
- Who secures me? (implemented for Components, Pages, Permission Lists, Portal Registry with access-path visualization)
- What breaks if I change? (impact analysis via Knowledge Graph traversal)
- Child records, subrecord derivations, and AE state records for Record objects

### Remaining

- Universal "what references me / what do I reference" coverage across all object types
- "Who executes me?" for runtime-linked objects (AEs, Service Operations)
- Consistent cross-reference sections in every UOM provider

---

# Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence

## Continuous Drift Detection

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph drift: compares current live graph against most-recent snapshot; surfaces new, removed, and changed nodes by type in the Graph Explorer DRIFT tab

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Knowledge Graph drift: compares current live graph against most-recent snapshot; surfaces new, removed, and changed nodes by type in the Graph Explorer DRIFT tab
- Menu comparison (`/api/envcompare/menus`) — diffs PSMENUDEFN (637 rows) including menutype, description, owner, timestamp
- Tree comparison (`/api/envcompare/trees`) — diffs PSTREEDEFN (326 rows), latest effective row per tree; shows status, description, timestamp
- IB Routing comparison (`/api/envcompare/ib_routings`) — diffs PSIBRTNGDEFN named routings (auto-generated excluded); shows type, operation, sender/receiver nodes
- IB Message comparison (`/api/envcompare/ib_messages`) — diffs PSMSGDEFN (4272 rows); shows status, description, owner
- Component Interface comparison (`/api/envcompare/ci`) — diffs PSBCDEFN; shows type, description, backing component (added 2026-07-01)
- AE step/body comparison (`/api/envcompare/ae-body`) — step-level diff; SQL text via PSAESTMTDEFN/PSSQLTEXTDEFN; unified diff per changed step (added 2026-07-01)
- Summary sidebar updated with Menus, Trees, IB Routings, IB Messages, Comp. Interfaces counts
- Environment Compare UI updated with 5 new tabs (Menus, Trees, IB Routings, IB Messages, Comp. Interfaces) + AE body drill-down within AE tab

### Remaining

Automatically detect changes in:

- PeopleCode (changed programs between environments) — ✅ already done (`/api/envcompare/peoplecode` + deep source diff)
- SQL definitions — ✅ already done (`/api/envcompare/sql_definitions`)
- Security (changed permission lists, roles) — ✅ already done (`/api/envcompare/permissions`, `/api/envcompare/roles`)
- Menus — ✅ added 2026-07-01
- Trees — ✅ added 2026-07-01
- Integration Broker metadata — ✅ added 2026-07-01 (routings + messages)

- Component interface comparison (`/api/envcompare/ci`) — diffs PSBCDEFN; shows type, description, backing component — ✅ added 2026-07-01
- AE program body comparison (`/api/envcompare/ae-body`) — step-level diff of PSAESTEPDEFN + SQL text from PSAESTMTDEFN/PSSQLTEXTDEFN; unified diff per changed step — ✅ added 2026-07-01

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Scheduled drift reports: `driftdb.py` SQLite store + scheduler daemon integration — runs envcompare summary after each graph snapshot cycle, persists point-in-time counts, auto-generates threshold alerts (|delta| ≥ 50) and growth-rate alerts (delta grows >10%), auto-resolves when drift subsides
- `/api/drift/snapshot` (POST) — manual trigger
- `/api/drift/latest`, `/api/drift/history`, `/api/drift/alerts` (GET)
- `/admin/drift` — drift history UI with sparklines, alert table, and Snapshot Now button

---

## Environment History

Maintain historical snapshots.

### ✅ Completed

- Environment comparison across HCM and FSCM for Records, Fields, PeopleCode, SQL Definitions, PS Queries, Portals, and Knowledge Graph
- Portal object deep comparison (definition diff, children diff, permissions diff)
- Operator comparison (roles, permission lists, component access diff between two OPRIDs)

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Point-in-time runtime snapshots: every drift cycle stores a full count snapshot in `drift.db` (16 object types per environment pair, timestamped)
- Temporal history of security and metadata changes: drift history API returns per-type time series; Drift History admin page visualizes trends with delta sparklines

### ✅ Completed (Phase 1 — 2026-07-01)

- Promotion event log: `connectors/promotiondb.py` SQLite store + `routers/promotions.py` REST API
  - `POST /api/promotions` — record an event (pillar, project, from_env, to_env, date, by, notes, ticket_ref)
  - `GET /api/promotions` — list events with pillar/project/env filters
  - `GET /api/promotions/timeline` — chronological view for a single project
  - `GET /api/promotions/summary` — per-project latest promotion summary for a pillar
  - `DELETE /api/promotions/{id}` — remove a record
  - `/admin/promotions` — log form + filterable timeline table; env suggestions (DV/TST/UAT/CRP/PAR/PER/PRD)
  - Phase 1 note displayed in UI; "Promotions" added to Runtime nav group

### Remaining (Phase 2 — Future)

- **Auto-detection from PSPROJECTDEFN**: when DV/TST/UAT/PRD Oracle DB connections are added to
  `config.json`, snapshot `PSPROJECTDEFN.LASTUPDDTTM` per environment, detect when a project's
  timestamp in the target env advances to match the source env — automatically record a promotion event.
  The Phase 1 SQLite schema and API are already designed to accommodate this without structural changes.
- **Lab context**: this system is a development lab. Promotion-chain environments (DV/TST/UAT/PRD)
  do not exist yet. HCM and FSCM are separate application pillars and are NOT in a promotion chain
  with each other. Phase 2 implementation begins when real promotion-chain DB connections are available.

---

## Impact Forecasting

Predict downstream impact before migration.

### ✅ Completed

- Knowledge Graph impact analysis (forward and reverse dependency traversal, upstream/downstream node enumeration by type)
- AE restart eligibility analysis

### ✅ Completed (2026-07-01)

- Pre-migration impact reports: `/admin/impact` — full project impact report with KG traversal, affected node breakdown by type, and per-object downstream count; warns when KG coverage is insufficient
- Deployment risk scoring: `/api/impact/risk` — KG-independent risk assessment using drift snapshot data; weights object types by risk (security=5×, PeopleCode/IB=4×, AE/SQL=3×, others=1×); returns per-type drift level (Minor/Moderate/Significant/Major) and overall risk label (Low/Medium/High/Critical); auto-loads on `/admin/impact` page open

---

# Long-Term Goals

PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence should become the definitive engineering, observability, and operational intelligence platform for PeopleSoft environments.

---

# Current Focus

## ✅ Phase 5 — Complete (as of 2026-07-01)

Phase 5 Knowledge Graph coverage is complete. 23 new providers were added across multiple sessions. All viable tables have been implemented; all unimplementable tables are documented in the Deprioritized Providers table above with reasons.

**IB Schema Definitions** (PSIBSCMADATA / PSIBSCMADFN) was the last candidate. Investigated 2026-07-01: no SELECT grant exists in HCM; PSIBSCMADATA stores raw XML as CLOB chunks — not browsable even with grants; PSIBSCMADFN header is redundant with existing PSMSGDEFN coverage. Deprioritized.

**Provider methodology for future sessions:**
1. Query `all_tab_columns` to find the real table and column names — never assume PeopleTools naming
2. Pull live sample rows to confirm usable keys and human-readable content
3. Write psdb.py → ptmetadata.py → graphdb.py → uom.py → routers/peoplesoft.py → routers/admin/<group>.py in order
4. Compile-check and smoke-test at each layer before proceeding
5. Document deprioritization reasons when tables are unimplementable

## Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence (Substantially Complete as of 2026-07-01)

Continuous drift detection, environment history, and impact forecasting are complete.

**Remaining:** Promotion history tracking (DEV → TEST → UAT → PROD) — needs design before implementation.

**What was delivered:**
- 16-type envcompare coverage (records, fields, components, pages, permissions, roles, AE, PeopleCode, SQL defs, portals, queries, menus, trees, IB routings, IB messages, comp. interfaces)
- AE step-level body comparison with unified SQL diff
- Scheduled drift snapshots (SQLite) with threshold + growth alerts, history time series
- KG-independent deployment risk scoring (weighted by object type) via `/api/impact/risk`
- Project impact reports via KG reverse traversal via `/api/impact/project`
- Admin pages: `/admin/drift`, `/admin/impact`
