  comparison with normalized diff mode, analytics, override intelligence)
- Plugin SDK v1 + v2 (object/graph/runtime providers, health checks, config-driven
  sources, admin pages) — no open candidates
- Admin shell smoke test harness (73 pages)

---

# Phase 4 — Runtime Intelligence

**Status: Substantially complete.**

### Completed
- Oracle session tracking, SQL/wait-event visibility, lock/blocking analysis
- Process Scheduler + Integration Broker runtime linkage; unified runtime graph API
- Runtime alerts (process errors, long processes, queue depth, blocking, domain health)
- Operational dashboard (`/admin/`) — live alerts, health, log intelligence, trend sparklines
- Runtime history persistence (`runtimedb.py`, 5-min snapshots, 1h/6h/24h/7d trend charts)
- Interactive infrastructure topology (`/admin/topology`)
- Incident Recording: full RCA snapshot capture (`incidentdb.py`) + replay UI (`/admin/incidents`)
- App Server live process tracking (`connectors/appsrvproc.py`, SSH `ps` + Tuxedo arg parsing) —
  goes one level below the domain-only `PSPMDOMAIN_VW` view

### Remaining — blocked on live traffic data
- **Browser session tracking**: `PIA_access.log` is 0 bytes in this environment (no HTTP
  access logging enabled) — nothing to ingest or verify against.
- **WebLogic session tracking**: `PIA_weblogic.log` has real content but zero
  session-lifecycle events — infrastructure/health noise only.
- Both need either real end-user PIA traffic or WebLogic access/session logging enabled
  before there's anything to build against.

---

# Phase 5 — Complete Knowledge Graph

**Status: ✅ Complete.** All ~54 UOM object-type providers are implemented and
KG-aligned (see "UOM/KG Alignment Audit" below).

### Provider coverage
Operators, Roles, Permission Lists, Components, Pages, Records, Fields, PeopleCode,
Application Engines, Integration Broker (Services/Nodes/Queues/Routings), Menus, Trees,
SQL Definitions, PS Queries, Component Interfaces, Portal Registry, Application Packages,
Message Catalog, Approval Framework, XML Publisher, Search Definitions/Categories,
Pivot Grids, Connected Queries, Process Definitions, File Layouts, Translate Values,
App Designer Projects, IB Messages/Applications/Service Groups/Routings, Application
Classes, Content Services, PTF Tests, ADS Definitions, URL Definitions, Chatbot Skills,
Style Sheets, Archive Objects, Timezones, Locales, PM Metrics/Transactions/Events,
SQR programs, COBOL programs/copybooks.

### ⚠️ Stub providers (no backing tables in this environment)
Guarded by `has_table()`, return empty/stub results without crashing:
Navigation Collections, Event Mappings, Related Content, Drop Zones.

### ⛔ Deprioritized providers
Investigated and deprioritized — reference table for future re-evaluation on other
environments/PeopleTools versions:

| Provider | Tables | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| IB Schema Definitions | PSIBSCMADATA / PSIBSCMADFN | CLOB-only / no grant / redundant with PSMSGDEFN |
| Navigation Collections | PTNC_COLLECTION | Does not exist |
| Event Mappings | PSEFMAPPINGDEFN | Does not exist |
| Related Content | PSRELCONDEFN | Does not exist |
| Drop Zones | PSPTDZDEFN | Does not exist |
| WorkCenters | — | No standalone definition table |
| Dashboards | PS_EOEN_DASHBRD | 0 rows |
| BI Publisher / Branding / Page Composer | — | No backing tables |
| Fluid Homepage / Tiles | PSPGEDEFN etc. | Absent or 0 rows |
| Activity Guide Collections | PS_AGC_TILE_TBL | 2 rows — too few |
| File Reference Definitions | PSFILEREDEFN | 19,622 rows, mostly system refs — marginal |
| Business Process Definitions | PSBUSPROCDEFN | Deprecated Workflow Navigator (2000–2002) |
| IB Local Schema | PSLSDEFN | Compressed binary — impractical |
| IB Service Setup | PSIBSVCSETUP | Single-row global config, not a catalog |

### Knowledge Graph relationships
Edge types in active use: `CALLS`, `REFERENCES`, `USES`, `CONTAINS`, `WRAPS`, `SECURES`,
`READS`/`WRITES`, `DEPLOYS`, `HAS_PERMISSION`, `HAS_MEMBER`, `SENDS`/`RECEIVES`,
`DECLARED_ON`, `EXPOSES`, `FIRES_BEFORE`/`FIRES_AFTER`, `BELONGS_TO`, `GENERATES`.

**✅ UOM/KG Alignment Audit — complete.** Every UOM object type's declared
`_relationships`/`_graph` now matches what's actually persisted in the Knowledge Graph.
Two-pass Explore-agent audit (all 54 provider types) found 10 genuine mismatches, all
fixed: `operator↔permissionlist`, `role↔operator`, `service_operation↔node`,
`portal_registry` (had zero KG persistence at all), `tree→field`,
`component_interface→menu/record/field`, AE `section` node-type unification + `CALLS`
edges, `component→record` broader page-usage, `page→page` subpages, and
`content_service↔portal_registry`. One item (page-level security) was correctly
re-scoped as not-a-gap — the data is already reachable via existing edges. Three
independent bugs were found and fixed along the way (an Oracle NULL-comparison bug in
`portal_registry_portals()`, a SQL-generation bug in a column-fallback rewrite, and a
self-loop bug in AE `CALLS` edges). Full narrative in `DEVELOPMENT_DIARY.md`.

**✅ Dynamic SQL READS/WRITES coverage.** PeopleCode `SQLExec(&var)`/`CreateSQL(&var)`
calls (SQL built into a variable beforehand) now contribute KG edges — previously only
inline-literal calls did. `connectors/peoplecode.py:extract_dynamic_sql()`
reconstructs the SQL text from prior `&var = ...` assignments; dynamically-chosen table
names are correctly left unresolved rather than guessed.

### Cross-references (Object Explorer "what references me / what do I reference")
Implemented for Records, Application Engines, SQL Definitions, PeopleCode, Pages,
Components, Menus, Queries, Trees, Portal Registry, Messages (READS/WRITES, "Used By",
"Deploys", access-path security chains). Universal coverage across *all* object types
remains open-ended — no further concrete gaps identified.

### AE PeopleCode-step edges — known limitation, not actionable here
`AE_ACTTYPE == 'P'` never matches in this environment's schema version, so AE→PeopleCode
`CONTAINS` edges are a no-op on both the UOM reference implementation and the KG side.
Pre-existing schema-version gap, not introduced by any work in this repo.

---

# Phase 6 — Environment Intelligence

**Status: Substantially complete.**

### Completed
- 23-type environment comparison (records, fields, components, pages, permissions,
  roles, AE, PeopleCode, SQL defs, portals, queries, menus, trees, IB routings, IB
  messages, component interfaces, process definitions, operators, translate values,
  IB nodes, style sheets, URL definitions, application packages) with AE step-level
  body diff
- Scheduled drift snapshots (SQLite `driftdb.py`) with threshold + growth-rate alerts
- Point-in-time runtime snapshots and drift history time series (`/admin/drift`)
- Deployment risk scoring (`/api/impact/risk`) and project impact reports
  (`/api/impact/project`, `/admin/impact`)
- Promotion event log (Phase 1): manual `POST /api/promotions` + timeline UI
  (`/admin/promotions`)

**Drift coverage expansion (17 → 23 types)**: `connectors/envcompare.py`'s `summary()`
is a single literal `(label, sql)` tuple list — purely additive, no UI changes needed
since `/admin/drift` renders whatever `/api/drift/latest` returns generically. Added
Operators (`PSOPRDEFN`), Translate Values (`PSXLATITEM`), IB Nodes (`PSMSGNODEDEFN`),
Style Sheets (`PSSTYLEDEFN`), URL Definitions (`PSURLDEFN`), and Application Packages
(`PSPACKAGEDEFN`) — each verified queryable with real, differing HCM/FSCM counts
before adding (e.g. Operators: 141 vs 398; Translate Values: 49,177 vs 60,749) rather
than assumed from UOM's ~54-type provider list. Two other UOM-adjacent candidates,
`PSFILELAYOUTDEFN` and `PSPRJDEFN`, were checked and don't exist under those names in
this environment (`ORA-00942`) — skipped rather than guessed at the real table name.
Since `/api/drift/latest` reads a **persisted** snapshot (not a live query), a fresh
`POST /api/drift/snapshot` had to be triggered to pick up the new types — pre-existing
snapshots only have the original 17.

### Remaining — blocked on real promotion-chain environments
- **Promotion auto-detection** (Phase 2): snapshot `PSPROJECTDEFN.LASTUPDDTTM` per
  environment and auto-record a promotion when a target env's timestamp advances to
  match the source. The Phase 1 schema/API already accommodate this without structural
  changes. **Lab context**: HCM and FSCM here are separate pillars, not a promotion
  chain — this needs real DV/TST/UAT/PRD connections to implement meaningfully.

---

# Phase 7 — AI Engineering Assistant

**Status: ✅ Complete.**

3-provider architecture (`connectors/ai.py` abstract interface; `ai_claude.py`/
`ai_openai.py`/`ai_ollama.py` implementations) so provider swaps require only a new
`ai_<name>.py` file. 21+ tools in `connectors/ai_tools.py`, each a thin adapter over an
existing connector (no new SQL): `search_objects`, `peoplecode_search`,
`graph_dependencies`, `graph_impact`, `who_has_access`, `ae_steps`, `sql_lookup`,
`envcompare_summary`, `project_impact`, `active_sessions`, `record_usage`,
`log_search`, `log_errors`, `session_log_chain`, `environment_health`,
`ib_diagnostics`, `process_scheduler_health`, `component_events` (now enriched with
canonical processing-sequence context), `sqr_program`, `cobol_program` (source-aware,
truncated to 12,000 chars — feeds "explain this program" questions), and
`peoplecode_sequence` (unified Component/Record/Page ordering questions). Streaming
chat UI at `/admin/assistant` with an agentic tool loop (up to 8 rounds).

Config: `config.json["ai"]`, provider selection + per-provider settings; env var
overrides (`CLAUDE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`) take precedence.

---

# Phase 8 — Log Intelligence

**Status: ✅ Complete** for Linux-hosted tiers.

### Architecture
All log sources are remote, fetched via SSH/SFTP (`connectors/sshclient.py`) with
per-file byte-offset tracking (only new content re-fetched). `ssh_hosts` in
`config.json` defines reusable connection profiles; `log_sources` / `igw_log_sources`
define what to ingest and how to parse it (`connectors/logparser.py`).

| Tier | Log type | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| F5 LTM | `f5_access` | Apache-combined (HSL iRule output) |
| nginx/Apache | `apache_access`/`apache_error` | Standard NCSA |
| WebLogic PIA | `pia_access`/`pia_error` | OPRID in auth field |
| Tuxedo App Server | `appsrv` | OPRID, ORA-, PC errors |
| Tuxedo ULOG | `tuxedo` | Domain-level events |
| Integration Gateway | `igw_error_log` | HTML block parser, 12 regex patterns |
| Process Scheduler (AESRV) | `prcs_ae` | Applid, process instance, error detection |

Storage: SQLite `data/logs.db` (`web_entries`, `app_entries`, `log_errors`), 30/90/90-day
retention. Session-chain correlation joins `PSACCESSLOG` → `web_entries` → `app_entries`
→ `log_errors` by OPRID and time window.

### Completed
- Full ingestion pipeline + 60s scheduler cycle; `/admin/logs`, `/admin/log_errors`,
  `/admin/log_viewer`, `/admin/log_session`, `/admin/igw`, `/admin/prcs-ae`
- AI tools: `log_search`, `log_errors`, `session_log_chain`
- Error surface grouped by code+object with "Ask AI" deep-links

### Remaining
- Process Scheduler log ingestion for **Windows-hosted** schedulers (SMB/WinRM
  transport) — blocked until a Windows scheduler server is available to test against.
  Design (`prcs_log_sources` transport types: `local`/`ssh_sftp`/`smb`/`winrm`/`agent`)
  is documented but unimplemented.
- `msgLog.html` (`igw_msg_log`): message logging is disabled in this environment — no
  file exists to parse against.

---

# Phase 9 — Platform Extensibility

**Status: ✅ v1 + v2 complete — no remaining candidates.**

Every extension surface (object providers, KG builders, runtime providers, admin
dashboards, health checks, config-driven ingest sources) was previously a hardcoded
literal list/dict/if-chain only core code could append to. `connectors/plugins.py`
adds one appendable registry per surface; `connectors/pluginloader.py` discovers and
loads `plugins/*.py` at startup with per-plugin isolation (a broken plugin logs a
warning and is skipped — verified the rest of the platform keeps working).
`plugins/example_hello.py` is a worked example exercising all six extension points.
Full SDK documentation in `PLUGINS.md`.

**Custom health checks**: `register_health_check(name, check_fn, label)` — distinct
from a runtime provider (raw status data for a human to read) in that a health check
returns a judgment (`ok`/`warn`/`error`) a dashboard can roll up or alert on. New
`GET /api/runtime/health-checks?env=` runs every registered check on demand (same
isolation contract as the rest of the SDK — a check that raises is reported as its
own `error` result, not a failed endpoint); new "Plugin Health Checks" card on
`/admin/runtime` (no per-check UI work needed, same as the existing Plugin Providers
card). `example_hello.py`'s worked example deliberately returns a real, non-trivial
`warn` (one of its three demo widgets, `CHARLIE`, is genuinely marked degraded) rather
than an always-`ok` stub — verified live via curl (`{"status": "warn", "message": "1
widget(s) degraded: CHARLIE"}`) and in a real headless Chrome session (card renders
correctly, zero console errors).

**Config-driven source API**: `register_source_type(name, config_key, ingest_fn,
status_fn)` replicates the SQR/COBOL ingest pattern (a `config.json` array of source
entries + an SSH-fetch-and-index pipeline) without a plugin needing to hand-roll its
own background-thread/lock/status-tracking boilerplate — the SDK runs `ingest_fn()`
in a background thread and tracks running/last-result generically. New
`routers/plugin_sources.py`: `GET /api/plugins/sources` (list registered types), `GET
/api/plugins/sources/{name}/entries?env=` (this type's config.json entries), `POST
/api/plugins/sources/{name}/ingest` (trigger background reindex), `GET
/api/plugins/sources/{name}/status`. `example_hello.py`'s worked example
(`hello_widgets` source type) increments a real counter each ingest rather than
returning a static stub — verified live via curl: `source_count: 0` correctly since
`hello_sources` isn't in `config.json` (honest, not an error), two separate `POST
.../ingest` calls correctly ran in background threads and `ingest_count` incremented
1 → 2 across them, and a request to an unregistered source type correctly 404s.

---

# Phase 10 — Source Artifact Intelligence

**Status: ✅ Complete.** SQR, SQC, and COBOL/copybook files are first-class UOM
objects participating in search, graph traversal, dependency analysis, and environment
comparison.

### SQR
- Source discovery + indexing (`sqringest.py`/`sqrdb.py`/`sqrparser.py`) — delivered +
  custom trees per env, incremental scan via MD5 `content_hash`
- `/admin/sqr` (list/detail/analytics), `/admin/sqrsearch` (full-text), `/admin/sqrdeps`
  (include dependency graph — forward tree, reverse "Included By", force-directed
  canvas), `/admin/sqrcompare` (HCM vs FSCM side-by-side diff)
- KG edges: `sqr_program → record` READS/WRITES, `sqr_program → sqr_program` INCLUDES,
  `prcs_defn → sqr_program` WRAPS

### COBOL
- `cobol_sources` config (4 entries: HCM/FSCM × delivered/custom). Discovery: PeopleSoft
  COBOL "copybooks" are `.cbl` files distinguished by the *absence* of `PROGRAM-ID`
  (pulled in via `COPY name.`), not a separate `.cpy` extension — none exist in this
  environment. Most delivered `.cbl` source is mode 700 (not readable by the SSH service
  account) — ingestor counts this as `denied`, not an error (115/977 readable here).
- `connectors/cobolparser.py`/`cobol_db.py`/`cobolingest.py`; `/admin/cobol` list +
  detail (Overview / COPY Dependency Graph / Source)
- KG edges: `cobol_program → record` READS/WRITES, `→ cobol_program` COPIES/CALLS
- `/admin/cobolcompare` (`cobol_db.envcompare_cobol()`, `GET /api/cobol/envcompare`) —
  HCM vs FSCM side-by-side diff, same shape/UI language as `/admin/sqrcompare` (a
  patch/drift-integrity check, not assumed feature parity — verified real data first:
  in this environment HCM/FSCM's 115 delivered `.cbl` files are byte-identical by
  content_hash, so it correctly reports 0 differences today; will surface real drift
  automatically the moment one environment gets patched independently of the other)

### SQR Override Intelligence — ✅ Complete
- `connectors/sqrdb.py`'s `override_summary()` classifies every configured delivered/
  custom source pair per env into three categories: **overridden** (same filename in
  both — customized copy of a delivered program), **custom-only** (filename exists only
  in custom — net-new custom code), **delivered-only** (count only, to avoid dumping
  hundreds of unmodified rows). Extends the older `/overrides` endpoint (which only
  detected the overridden/duplicate-filename case) to the full picture.
- `GET /api/sqr/override-summary?env=` — verified live against real Oracle-backed index
  data (`hcm_sqr_delivered`/`fscm_sqr_delivered`, 179 programs each); this environment's
  custom-source trees are empty so the honest live result is `0 overridden / 0 custom-only
  / 179 delivered-only` per env — correctness of the categorization logic itself was
  proven separately against a scratch copy of `sqr.db` seeded with a synthetic override
  row and a synthetic custom-only row.
- `/admin/sqroverrides` — new admin page (stat cards + tabbed overridden/custom-only
  tables per environment).

### AI-Assisted Explanation — ✅ Complete
- `connectors/ai_tools.py`'s existing `sqr_program` tool now also returns indexed
  `source_text` (previously only metadata/tables/includes), truncated to 12,000 chars
  (`_truncate_source()`) to stay within a reasonable tool-result token budget —
  verified against the largest indexed program (`sysrtdfn.sqc`, 171,506 chars raw).
- New `cobol_program` tool (mirrors `sqr_program`'s shape: `program`/`table_users`/
  `search` lookup types, plus COBOL-specific `copy_deps`) — COBOL had no AI tool at
  all before this; same source-text truncation applied.
- With real source in the tool result, "explain/summarize/assess this program" falls
  out of the existing agentic tool loop for free — no new endpoint, no separate
  summarization pipeline. Verified live end-to-end against the real OpenAI-backed
  assistant (`/admin/assistant`): asked it to explain both `PTCALOGM.cbl` (COBOL) and
  `sysrtdfn.sqc` (SQR) — it correctly invoked the new/updated tools and produced
  accurate plain-English explanations matching the real source.

### Analytics Dashboards — ✅ Complete
- SQR already had `/admin/sqr/analytics` (top tables, most-complex programs, most-
  included SQCs, release breakdown) — pre-existing, no change.
- Added the COBOL equivalent: `connectors/cobol_db.py`'s `analytics()` (top tables,
  most-complex programs by table count, most-COPYd copybooks, delivered/custom
  breakdown), `GET /api/cobol/analytics`, and `/admin/cobol/analytics` (linked from
  the COBOL Explorer toolbar). Also added `/admin/cobol/table/{table_name}` (COBOL
  had `/api/cobol/table/{table_name}` already, but no admin page for it — SQR's
  equivalent page existed, COBOL's didn't).
- **Real finding, not a bug**: `top_tables` is empty for COBOL — `cobol_tables` has
  0 rows in this environment (verified: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cobol_tables` → 0),
  while `cobol_copies` (806 rows) and `cobol_calls` (328 rows) are populated. The
  page renders this honestly (empty table section) rather than erroring.
- **Bug found and fixed while adding this**: registering `/cobol/table/{table_name}`
  and `/cobol/analytics` *after* the existing `/cobol/{filename}` catch-all route
  caused FastAPI to match `/admin/cobol/analytics` against `/cobol/{filename}`
  (filename="analytics") first, since routes match in registration order — the new
  analytics page silently served the wrong content. Fixed by moving both new routes
  before the catch-all. Also fixed a small pre-existing bug copied from the SQR
  analytics page pattern: an undefined `$()` DOM helper (SQR's `/admin/sqr/table/
  {table_name}` page has the same latent bug, out of scope to fix here since it
  predates this work and isn't part of what broke).

### Broader Diff Modes — ✅ Complete
`envcompare_sqr()`/`envcompare_cobol()` gained a `diff_mode` parameter: `"exact"`
(unchanged, raw `content_hash` equality) or `"normalized"` (ignore comment lines and
insignificant whitespace). Normalized mode only re-checks pairs whose `content_hash`
already differs — an extra `source_text` fetch + comparison for just those rows — so
exact mode stays exactly as cheap as before. Comment-stripping reuses each parser's
own existing convention rather than inventing a new one: SQR's `!`-prefixed comment
lines (`sqrparser.py`'s `_RE_COMMENT_LINE`) and COBOL's fixed-format column-7 `*`
(`cobolparser.py`'s `_RE_COMMENT_LINE`). `/admin/sqrcompare` and `/admin/cobolcompare`
both got an "Exact match" / "Ignore whitespace/comments" toggle; the changed-files
table now labels whitespace/comment-only diffs distinctly (`DIFFERS (whitespace/
comments only)`) instead of just `DIFFERS`.

Since HCM/FSCM are byte-identical in this environment for both SQR and COBOL (no real
diffs to demonstrate against), verified correctness with scratch-DB tests (same
methodology as SQR Override Intelligence): cloned a real program into the other
environment's source tree with (a) an added comment line + trailing whitespace only
— confirmed normalized mode correctly reports `changed: false`, `content_normalized_
same: true`, while exact mode still reports `changed: true`; and (b) a genuine
non-comment token inserted mid-file — confirmed normalized mode still catches it
(`changed: true`, `content_normalized_same: false`). Repeated for both SQR (`!`
comments) and COBOL (column-7 `*` comments) source. Also verified live in a headless
browser: toggling to "Ignore whitespace/comments" on `/admin/sqrcompare` and calling
`load()` correctly re-fetches with `diff_mode=normalized` and renders real counts.

### Runtime Correlation — ✅ Complete (gracefully degrading, no real data to verify against)
Ties Process Scheduler executions back to SQR/COBOL source: `psdb.process_runs_for_program()`
queries `PSPRCSRQST` by `PRCSNAME` (derived from the source filename's base name) and
`PRCSTYPE` (`SQR Report`/`SQR Process` for SQR, `COBOL SQL` for COBOL), reusing the
`_RUNSTATUS_LABEL` map and column-existence detection already established by
`operator_processes()`. New `GET /api/sqr/program/{filename}/runs` and `GET
/api/cobol/program/{filename}/runs`; new "Process Runs" tab on both program detail
admin pages showing instance/run-control/start-time/duration/status/server/OPRID.

**Verified this was worth building despite zero real data before writing any code**:
researched via a background agent first — `PS_PRCSDEFN` confirms the join key
(`PRCSNAME`) is real (1510 SQR Report + 21 SQR Process + 52 COBOL SQL defs in HCM
alone), but `PSPRCSRQST` (actual run history) has **zero rows** for those `PRCSTYPE`
values in either HCM or FSCM — every real run-history row there is Application
Engine only. Confirmed with the user this is worth building anyway (same call as
Page-owned PeopleCode): the query mechanics are real and will activate automatically
the moment an environment has real SQR/COBOL run history, so it's verified two ways
— (1) gracefully empty for real SQR/COBOL programs today (not an error), and (2)
proven correct against a real *populated* process name (`PSPM_REAPER`, Application
Engine, 512 real runs) to confirm the SQL/dispatch logic itself works, not just that
it always returns nothing.

**Bug found and fixed**: `duration_secs` (computed as `end_dt - run_dt`) was always
`None` even for completed runs with both timestamps populated — `psdb.query()`
returns Oracle datetimes as ISO strings, not Python `datetime` objects, so the
subtraction silently raised `TypeError` inside a bare `except: pass`. Fixed by
parsing both timestamps with `datetime.fromisoformat()` before subtracting;
re-verified against `PSPM_REAPER`'s real runs (31.2s, 29.5s durations, correctly
`None` for the still-running instance with no `end_dt`).

**Bigger bug found and fixed, pre-existing before this session**: while wiring up
COBOL's new tab, `cobol_detail`'s entire JS (not just the new tab — Dependency Graph
and Source too) turned out to already be broken in a way identical to the SQR
Overrides brace-doubling bug from earlier this session, just never caught: the
segment after `""" + _ESC_JS + """` is a plain string, not an f-string, but the code
used `{filename!r}` (three times) expecting f-string evaluation — it never
evaluated, emitting the literal text `{filename!r}` into served JavaScript and
breaking it outright. `git show HEAD` confirmed this predates all of today's
session work; it was never caught because individual object detail pages
(`/admin/cobol/{filename}`) aren't in the smoke test's page list, only list/compare
pages are. Fixed by precomputing `filename_js = json.dumps(filename)` and
concatenating it in (matching the established `+ variable +` convention used
elsewhere in this file), and de-doubling every brace in that segment to match its
actual plain-string nature. Verified all three previously-broken tabs (Overview
was fine; Dependency Graph, Source, and the new Process Runs) now render real data
with zero console errors in a real headless Chrome session.

### Remaining
- Syntax-aware diffing (AST-level comparison, not just comment/whitespace
  normalization) — no concrete blocker, just a larger lift than this pass.

# Phase 11 — SQL Proxy: AI-Safe Data Access

**Status: 📋 Planned — design complete, implementation not started.**

## Why

The AI Assistant (Phase 7) can today reason about *metadata* — object definitions,
dependencies, log errors, runtime state — but every one of its 21 tools wraps a
fixed, pre-written query. It cannot ask its own ad-hoc question of the data (e.g.
"show me the actual JOB rows for employees where this Application Engine step
failed"). That's a real gap: diagnosing whether an incident is *program-related*
(a bug in delivered/custom code) or *data-related* (a bad row, an out-of-range
value, a broken foreign key) usually requires looking at the data itself, not just
the schema.

The blocker to closing that gap isn't capability, it's exposure: PeopleSoft data
is full of PII/PHI/financial data (`PS_PERSONAL_DATA`, `PS_JOB`, `PS_PAYCHECK`,
`PS_BENEFITS`, ...), and hosting-provider AI models should never see raw employee
names, SSNs, salaries, or emails. `SQL_PROXY.md` (repo root) sketches an idealized
architecture for this: every AI SQL request flows through a proxy that validates,
executes, and *deterministically masks* the result before the AI ever sees it — the
same employee always maps to the same masked token everywhere, so cross-table
joins/troubleshooting still work, but the AI never learns who the employee
actually is. A human operator can then decode a specific masked token back to the
real value to act on the finding.

## What already exists that this builds on (not a from-scratch build)

`SQL_PROXY.md`'s design reads as if the read-only-execution/validation/audit layer
needs to be built. It doesn't — `connectors/sqlws.py` (SQL Workspace, the existing
human-facing query tool at `/admin/sqlws`) already implements almost the entire
"Query Validation," "Read Only," "Automatic Row Limiting," and "Query Audit
Logging" sections of `SQL_PROXY.md`, in production, today:

- `validate_readonly()` — blocks all DML/DDL/PL·SQL (`INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/
  `MERGE`/`DROP`/`ALTER`/`CREATE`/`GRANT`/`COMMIT`/...), rejects `DBMS_*`/`UTL_*`
  package calls, `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` dynamic SQL, `SYS.*` privilege-escalation
  patterns, and multi-statement (`;`-separated) submissions — comment/string-
  literal-stripped before keyword scanning, not naive substring matching.
- `execute_query()` — `ROW_NUMBER()`-wrapper paging (never loads unbounded result
  sets), bind-variable support, server-side timeout, cancellation.
- `audit_write()` / `logs/sqlws_audit.jsonl` — every execution and every blocked
  attempt logged with timestamp, env, SQL text, elapsed time, row count, status.
- `history_list()` / `data/sqlws_history.jsonl` — queryable execution history.

**The genuinely new work is exactly the piece `SQL_PROXY.md` calls "Deterministic
Data Masking"** — nothing else needs reinventing. This phase reuses
`connectors/sqlws.py`'s validation/execution/audit path as-is and adds a masking
layer between "query executed" and "AI sees the result."

## Design

### 1. `connectors/sqlmask.py` — deterministic masking engine

- **Sensitive column catalog**: a configurable `{column_name_pattern: category}`
  map (seeded from `SQL_PROXY.md`'s own Token Categories table — `EMPLID`→`EMP`,
  `OPRID`→`USER`, `EMAIL_ADDR`→`EMAIL`, `NATIONAL_ID`/`SSN`→`SSN`, `NAME`/
  `FIRST_NAME`/`LAST_NAME`→`PERSON`, `ADDRESS1`/`ADDRESS2`→`ADDR`, `PHONE`→`PHONE`,
  `BANK_ACCOUNT`/`ACCOUNT_NUM`→`ACCT`, ...), stored in `config.json["sql_proxy"]`
  so it's tunable per-deployment without a code change — matched by exact column
  name and by regex (to catch `.*_SSN`, `.*_EMAIL` variants across custom fields).
- **Token generation**: `TOKEN = PREFIX + "_" + HMAC-SHA256(secret_salt, value)[:8]`
  (hex). HMAC (not plain `SHA256(salt+value)`) specifically so the salt can't be
  brute-forced out of a leaked token set the way a naive concatenation can.
  `secret_salt` lives in `config.json`, never logged, never returned to the AI.
  Deterministic: the same real value always produces the same token, so
  `PS_PERSONAL_DATA`, `PS_JOB`, and `PS_BENEFITS` rows for the same employee mask
  to the *same* `EMP_xxxxxxxx` token — joins and cross-table reasoning stay
  possible for the AI, it just never learns the real identity.
- **Token vault** (`data/sql_proxy_vault.db`, new SQLite store, mirroring the
  `data/*.db` side-store convention already used by `driftdb.py`/`incidentdb.py`/
  etc.): `(category, real_value, masked_token, created_ts, last_used_ts)`,
  populated lazily the first time a value is masked. This is what makes human
  decode possible later — the mapping is stored once, not regenerated.
- **Row masking**: given a result set (`columns`, `rows` — the exact shape
  `sqlws.execute_query()` already returns) and the sensitive-column catalog, walk
  each row and replace matched-column values with their token. Non-matched
  columns (dates, statuses, counts, amounts *not* configured as sensitive) pass
  through unmodified — per `SQL_PROXY.md`'s own stated goal, over-masking breaks
  troubleshooting as badly as under-masking breaks privacy.

### 2. AI-facing execute tool

- New `connectors/ai_tools.py` tool, `execute_sql(env, sql, max_rows=50)`:
  calls `sqlws.execute_query()` (reusing its validation/paging/audit path
  unchanged), then runs the result through `sqlmask.mask_result()` before
  returning it to the AI. A tighter `max_rows` cap than the human SQL Workspace
  default (50 vs. 100–1000) — the AI needs enough rows to spot a pattern, not a
  full dump.
- This is the actual capability the user asked for: the AI reviews an error
  (via existing `log_errors`/`ae_steps`/`process_scheduler_health` tools), forms
  a hypothesis about *which table/row* might explain it, and can now write and
  run its own `SELECT` to check — getting back masked-but-structurally-real data
  to reason from, rather than being stuck at "I'd need to look at the data to
  confirm this."
- Every AI-originated execution still lands in the *same* `sqlws_audit.jsonl`
  audit trail as human executions (tagged distinctly, e.g. `source: "ai"` vs.
  `source: "human"`), so there is one auditable trail of everything anyone (or
  anything) has queried — not a second, separate logging path to keep in sync.

### 3. Human reveal capability

- New endpoint, e.g. `POST /api/sql-proxy/reveal {"token": "EMP_9a41c2f0"}` →
  looks up the vault, returns the real value, updates `last_used_ts`, and is
  itself audit-logged (who decoded what, when). This endpoint is **never**
  registered as an AI tool — the AI dispatch table (`ai_tools._HANDLERS`) simply
  has no path to it, which is a stronger guarantee than a permission check that
  could be bypassed by a prompt.
- Admin UI: when the AI Assistant's chat response contains a masked token
  (`/admin/assistant`), render it as a small clickable chip; clicking calls the
  reveal endpoint and swaps in the real value inline for the human viewer only —
  this is the concrete answer to "the AI reports where the problem is, the user
  sees the actual data."

### 4. Verification plan (must pass before calling any part of this done)

- Determinism: masking the same real value twice (same or different query)
  produces the identical token; masking two different real values never
  collides (birthday-bound check across a large sample, not just eyeballing a
  few).
- Real-data test: run a real `SELECT EMPLID, NAME, EMAIL_ADDR, LASTUPDDTTM FROM
  PS_PERSONAL_DATA FETCH FIRST 20 ROWS ONLY` against live HCM/FSCM Oracle,
  confirm `EMPLID`/`NAME`/`EMAIL_ADDR` come back masked and `LASTUPDDTTM` (not
  configured as sensitive) comes back real and unmodified.
- Cross-table join test: mask the same real `EMPLID` via two different queries
  (e.g. one against `PS_PERSONAL_DATA`, one against `PS_JOB`) and confirm both
  produce the identical token — proves cross-table correlation survives masking.
- Reveal round-trip: mask a value, call the reveal endpoint with the resulting
  token, confirm the original real value comes back exactly.
- Negative test: confirm the AI dispatch table (`ai_tools._HANDLERS`) has no
  entry that can reach the reveal endpoint or the vault directly — the isolation
  is structural (no code path exists), not just a runtime permission check.
- `validate_readonly()` regression: confirm the existing SQL Workspace blocked-
  statement test coverage (`tests/test_sqlws_timeout.py` and friends) still
  passes unchanged, since this phase must not touch that validation logic.

## Explicitly out of scope for this phase (per `SQL_PROXY.md`'s "Future
Enhancements," not needed for the core ask)

- Free-text field masking (`COMMENTS`/`DESCRLONG`/`MESSAGE_TEXT` — named-entity
  masking is a materially harder problem than column-based tokenization; punt
  until a real free-text-leak incident makes it a priority)
- Numeric range-bucketing / date-shifting (salary → "100K–110K", dates shifted
  by a consistent offset) — real but secondary to identity masking
  for the stated use case (diagnosing errors), can layer on later
  without changing the token-vault architecture
- Dynamic Policy Engine / YAML-driven policies, AI Trust Levels (Observer/
  Analyst/Engineer/Administrator), Oracle Data Safe integration — all listed as
  "Future Enhancements" in `SQL_PROXY.md` itself, not required for v1

# Processing Sequence Intelligence

**Status: v1 + Record extension complete** (Component and Record contexts — see
Remaining for why Page was *not* given a mirrored "sequence").

Teaches the platform how PeopleSoft component/record processing executes in order,
not just which events exist.

### Completed — Component (v1)
- `/admin/compflow` (Component Event Flow) and `/admin/compseq` (PC Timeline): canonical
  20-event sequence (Search → Build → Interaction → Save) with delivered/custom
  detection and inline source viewing
- `connectors/peoplecode.py`: `CANONICAL_COMPONENT_SEQUENCE` + `component_sequence()` —
  moved the canonical sequence from a page-local JS array into a real, independently
  queryable backend artifact (`GET /api/peoplesoft/components/{comp}/sequence`)
- KG: `component_event` node type with `FIRES_BEFORE`/`FIRES_AFTER` edges between
  consecutive non-empty canonical events (`connectors/graphdb.py:component_sequences()`)
- AI: `component_events` tool fixed to call the real backing function (was calling a
  stale duplicate) and enriched with canonical sequence context
- Incident RCA (`/admin/rca`): correlates Process Failures, Log Errors, Oracle ASH, and
  IB Errors into one timeline

### Completed — Record + Page (extension, not a Component mirror)
Extending this to Page/Record was initially scoped as "give them the same sequence
Component has" — investigation (confirmed against live HCM/FSCM data) showed that's
wrong for Page and right, but differently-shaped, for Record:

- **Record** has a genuinely independent PeopleCode event set (`PSPCMPROG
  OBJECTID1=1` — Record Field PeopleCode: FieldDefault, FieldFormula, RowInit,
  RowSelect, FieldEdit, FieldChange, RowInsert, RowDelete, SaveEdit, SavePreChange,
  SavePostChange — owned by the record itself, independent of any component).
  `connectors/peoplecode.py`: `record_sequence()` reuses
  `CANONICAL_COMPONENT_SEQUENCE`'s real event vocabulary/order, filtered to only the
  events valid for record-owned code (excludes Component-only events like
  PreBuild/PostBuild/Activate/Workflow/SearchInit/SearchSave, which require a
  component context). `GET /api/peoplesoft/records/{rec}/sequence`. New "Processing
  Sequence" tab on the Record Explorer (`routers/admin/security.py`). KG:
  `record_event` node type with `FIRES_BEFORE`/`FIRES_AFTER` edges
  (`connectors/graphdb.py:record_sequences()`).
- **Page has no independent processing sequence** — `uom.py` already documents "Pages
  do not own PeopleCode directly; it is attached at the component level" for the
  events Component sequencing already covers. A synthetic "canonical Page sequence"
  would have been fake. What Page *does* have is a real, separate, currently-unindexed
  category: `OBJECTID1=8` ("Page" — already mapped in `peoplecode.py`'s
  `PEOPLECODE_OBJECT_TYPES` dict, but nothing queried it before this). Confirmed via
  live query this is 0 rows in both HCM and FSCM — real and queryable, just
  unpopulated here (same class of gap as several existing 0-row stub providers).
  `connectors/peoplecode.py`: `page_owned_events()` — a flat list (no multi-phase
  ordering, since there's no rich lifecycle at this level), gracefully returns empty
  rather than erroring. `GET /api/peoplesoft/pages/{page}/owned-events`. New
  "Page-Owned PeopleCode" tab on the Page Explorer (`routers/admin/platform.py`),
  clearly distinct from the existing per-component PeopleCode tab. **Not added to the
  KG in this pass** — 0 rows everywhere means nothing to verify the edge-building
  logic against; add a builder later if an environment has real `OBJECTID1=8` data.

**Verified**: `record_sequence('HCM', 'JOB')` correctly slots real Build/Interaction/
Save events and correctly excludes Search-phase Component-only events; graph rebuild
produced `record_event` nodes/edges with zero self-loops from the start (applied the
`component_sequences()` dedup fix proactively); `page_owned_events()` returns
`{"events": []}` gracefully for a real page, not an error. `make check` 91/91; smoke
test 69/69 (additions to existing pages, not new dedicated routes).

### Processing Path Explorer UI — ✅ Complete (Component + Record)
`/admin/compseq` ("PC Timeline") already had a rich ordered phase-card visualization
for Component sequences (grid of phase columns, per-slot delivered/custom/empty
coloring, inline source viewing) — the Record Explorer's "Processing Sequence" tab,
by contrast, only had a plain per-phase table. Added a Component/Record mode toggle
to `/admin/compseq` reusing the exact same visual language (phase cards, stats row,
legend, click-to-expand slots) for Record sequences too, rather than building a
separate page or a generic new visualization — `renderRecord()` consumes the
already-phased `record_sequence()` API response directly (no client-side canonical-
sequence re-derivation needed, unlike Component mode, since Record's backend already
groups events by phase). Record-mode slots show field/last-editor/timestamp metadata
on click (no source-code viewing — no per-event source endpoint exists for
record-owned PeopleCode, unlike Component's `/event-source`; the page says so
honestly rather than pretending).

**Verified live in a real headless browser** (not just curl): switched to Record
mode, entered `JOB`, confirmed 4 phase cards / 158 slots / 154-with-PeopleCode
render matching `record_sequence('HCM','JOB')` directly; clicked a populated slot
and confirmed the metadata panel opens with correct field/status; re-verified
Component mode (`JOB_DATA`) still renders identically post-change (20 slots, no
regression).

### AI-Assisted Sequence Explanation — ✅ Complete
Added `peoplecode_sequence` to `connectors/ai_tools.py` — a unified AI tool covering
Component/Record/Page ordering questions ("what fires before Save on JOB_DATA?", "is
FieldDefault in Build or Interaction phase?"), dispatching to the existing
`component_sequence()`/`record_sequence()`/`page_owned_events()` connector functions
by a `target_type` parameter rather than three separate tools. Complements the
existing `component_events` tool (flat listing, no ordering context) — this one is
specifically for ordering/sequence reasoning. No new chat UI needed: with real
canonical-sequence data in the tool result, ordering questions fall out of the
existing agentic tool loop for free, the same pattern used for SQR/COBOL explain.

**Verified live against the real OpenAI-backed assistant** (`/admin/assistant`, not
just dispatch()-level): asked "is FieldDefault in the Build phase or Interaction
phase?" for record JOB — correctly answered Build phase; asked "what fires
immediately before SaveEdit?" for component JOB_DATA — correctly answered RowDelete
(independently confirmed against `component_sequence('HCM','JOB_DATA')` directly:
Interaction Phase ends with RowDelete, Save Phase begins with SaveEdit).

### AE-Focused Runtime Trace Slice — ✅ Complete
The narrower, unblocked half of "Runtime Trace Correlation": `execution.instance_trace()`
composes what's already real and queryable for a single Process Scheduler instance —
`PSPRCSRQST` run detail, the AE program definition (`ae.program()`, if this instance is
an Application Engine run), Oracle ASH wait events/top SQL correlated to the run window
(reusing the existing `oracle_ash_for_process()`, which already filters by PSAE
module/action), and log errors within the run window (`logdb.query_errors()`). New
`GET /api/runtime/process/{instance}/trace`; new "AE / Log Errors" tab on the process
detail panel (`/admin/runtime`), alongside the pre-existing Oracle ASH and Exec Log
tabs (left untouched — the ASH view there already covered that ground well; this adds
the AE program description and correlated log errors that weren't shown anywhere).

**Deliberately does not claim step-by-step AE execution timing** — no
`PSAERUNCNTL`/`PS_AE_TRACE`/`PSAEMSGLOG` table is present or queryable in this
environment (confirmed via research before building), so that narrower "which step
ran when" view isn't attempted or faked; this composes what's real, not a simulation
of what isn't.

**Verified live** against a real 6.6-hour Application Engine run (`PRCSYSPURGE`,
instance 606596): correct AE program description ("Prcs Rqst & Rpt Mgr Purge"), real
ASH wait events (`db file sequential read`, 100%) with real top SQL text (`SELECT
AE_MESSAGE_PARMS FROM PSAESTEPMSGDEFN...`) correlated to the run window — a short
~15s `PSPM_REAPER` run was tried first and correctly showed 0 ASH samples (thin
sample density for short runs, not a bug), so a longer-running instance was used to
prove the correlation logic itself works. Verified live in a real headless Chrome
session: the new tab renders correctly with zero console errors, and the
pre-existing ASH/Exec Log tabs show no regression.

### Sequence-Aware Graph Relationships — ✅ Partially complete (the semantically-groundable half)
Added `VALIDATES_BEFORE_SAVE`, `MUTATES_DATABASE`, and `MUTATES_BUFFER` edges to
`component_sequences()`/`record_sequences()`, alongside the existing `FIRES_BEFORE`/
`FIRES_AFTER`/`BELONGS_TO`. `connectors/peoplecode.py`'s new `event_semantic_edges()`
classifies each canonical event by its own already-documented PeopleTools semantics
(the same meaning already captured in each event's `note` field, e.g. SavePreChange/
SavePostChange are literally "before/after DB write") — not a new or fabricated
classification, just wiring existing knowledge into the graph as edges: `SaveEdit` →
`VALIDATES_BEFORE_SAVE`, `SavePreChange`/`SavePostChange` → `MUTATES_DATABASE`, and
the Build/Interaction-phase buffer-mutating events (`RowInit`, `FieldDefault`,
`FieldFormula`, `RowSelect`, `FieldEdit`, `FieldChange`, `RowInsert`, `RowDelete`) →
`MUTATES_BUFFER`.

`PART_OF_SEQUENCE`, `CALLS_DURING_EVENT`, `BLOCKS_PROCESSING`, and
`TRIGGERS_RUNTIME_ACTION` remain unbuilt — each would need data this platform doesn't
track (a real PeopleCode call graph, workflow-trigger detection, or save-failure/
error-path data), not just a classification of what's already known, so they weren't
attempted rather than faked.

**Verified**: full graph rebuild (`env=HCM, limit=50, persist=true`) — both providers
ran clean (`component_sequences`: 38 items, `record_sequences`: 29 items, zero
errors); directly inspected the persisted graph (`data/knowledge_graph_HCM.json`) and
confirmed 49 real semantic edges (38 `MUTATES_BUFFER`, 8 `VALIDATES_BEFORE_SAVE`, 3
`MUTATES_DATABASE`) correctly connecting real `component_event` nodes to their real
`component` nodes, zero self-loops.

### Remaining
- **Delivered vs Custom Sequence Comparison** beyond the existing `LASTUPDOPRID`
  heuristic — PeopleCode has no delivered-source baseline to diff against (unlike
  SQR/COBOL, which have real parallel delivered+custom trees)
- True step-by-step AE execution timing — blocked on no `PSAERUNCNTL`/`PS_AE_TRACE`/
  `PSAEMSGLOG` table being present in this environment; PeopleCode-component-level
  trace correlation remains blocked on the same missing-PIA-data issue as Phase 4's
  session tracking
- `PART_OF_SEQUENCE`, `CALLS_DURING_EVENT`, `BLOCKS_PROCESSING`,
  `TRIGGERS_RUNTIME_ACTION` — blocked on call-graph/workflow-trigger/error-path data
  this platform doesn't track (see above)

---

# Digital Twin Persistence

**Status: Foundational pieces complete; full vision open-ended.**

### Completed
- Knowledge Graph snapshots (creation, listing, comparison, scheduled daily builds,
  retention pruning); graph drift detection against snapshot baseline
- Incident recording with full runtime state capture (see Phase 4)
- Environment/security change history via drift time series (see Phase 6)

### Remaining
- Full change history across all object types (drift covers 23 types, not universal —
  UOM has ~54; remaining types are either row-count-uninteresting or need real
  table-name verification before adding, per the process used to add the last 6)
- Deployment/configuration history beyond the promotion event log
- Runtime replay beyond incident snapshots
- Architecture Assistant: auto-generated dependency reports, sequence diagrams,
  technical documentation, impact summaries — not started

# Long-Term Goals

PeopleSoft Hypergraph Intelligence should become the definitive engineering,
observability, and operational intelligence platform for PeopleSoft environments.

---

## Provider methodology (for adding new UOM/KG providers)

1. Query `all_tab_columns` to find the real table/column names — never assume
   PeopleTools naming conventions.
2. Pull live sample rows to confirm usable keys and human-readable content.
3. Write `psdb.py` → `ptmetadata.py` → `graphdb.py` → `uom.py` →
   `routers/peoplesoft.py` → `routers/admin/<group>.py`, in that order.
4. Compile-check and smoke-test at each layer before proceeding.
5. Verify against a real graph rebuild (`curl /api/graph/build`) and inspect
   `graph["providers"][].status` — a clean compile does not mean the SQL runs
   correctly. Several real bugs this project has hit were only caught this way.
6. Document deprioritization reasons in the table above when a table is unimplementable
   in this environment.
